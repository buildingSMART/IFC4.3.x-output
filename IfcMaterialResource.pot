msgid "IfcMaterialLayerSet_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] is a designation by which materials of an element constructed of a number of material layers is known and through which the relative positioning of individual layers can be expressed. The Material Layer Set Base MlsBase describes the imaginary axis along which the material layers are positioned. In case of assigning the [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] directly to an element or element type, the individual layers are stacked according to their position within the list of MaterialLayers without providing information on how to spatially relate the material layer information to the shape representation of the element or element type. In case of assigning the [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] through an [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] to an element, the MlsBase is positioned along the reference axis or reference plane of the element. An offset from the reference axis or plane to MlsBase is supported by [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] which combines layers and an offset. Offsets from element edges are supported by the subtype [[IfcMaterialLayerWithOffsets]] . The positive LayerSetDirection MlsDirection describes the direction by which the individual material layers are stacked. The [[IfcMaterialLayer]] s are stacked with no gap. Gaps within a material layer set are expressed as layers by themselves. EXAMPLE A cavity brick wall would be modeled as [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] consisting of three [[IfcMaterialLayer]] s brick, air cavity and brick.

msgstr "IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage"

msgid "IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] determines the usage of [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] in terms of its location and orientation relative to the associated element geometry. The location of material layer set shall be compatible with the building element geometry that is, material layers shall fit inside the element geometry . The rules to ensure the compatibility depend on the type of the building element. EXAMPLE For a cavity brick wall with shape representation SweptSolid, the [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]].TotalThickness shall be equal to the wall thickness. Also the OffsetFromReferenceLine shall match the exact positions between the two shape representations of [[IfcWallStandardCase]] , that is the [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] s with RepresentationIdentifier Axis and RepresentationIdentifier Body . NOTE Model view definitions or implementer agreements may provide more instructions on matching between building element geometry and material layer set usage. The [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] is always assigned to an individual occurrence object and only to relevant subtypes of [[IfcElement]] . The [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] , referenced by ForLayerSet , can however be shared among several occurrence objects. If the element type is available in other words, an instance of the relevant subtype of [[IfcElementType]] exists , then the [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] can be assigned to the element type. The assignment between a subtype of [[IfcElement]] and the [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] is handled by [[IfcRelAssociatesMaterial]] . .use head Attribute use definition The [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] is primarily intended to be associated with planar building elements having a constant thickness. With further agreements on the interpretation of LayerSetDirection , the usage can be extended also to other cases, for example to curved building elements, provided that the material layer thicknesses are constant. Generally, an element may be layered in any of its primary directions, denoted by its x, y or z axis. The geometry use definitions at each specific type of building element will determine the applicable LayerSetDirection . The following examples illustrate how the [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] attributes LayerSetDirection , DirectionSense , OffsetFromReferenceLine can be used in different cases. Normative material use definitions are documented at each element how these shall be used . Figure 1 shows an example of the use of [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] aligned to the axis of a wall. EXAMPLE For a standard wall with extruded geometric representation vertical extrusion , the layer set direction will be perpendicular to extrusion direction, and can be derived from the direction of the wall axis. With the DirectionSense positive in this example the individual IfcMaterialLayers are assigned consecutively right to left or left to right. For a curved wall, direction denoting the wall thickness can be derived from the direction of the wall axis, and it will remain perpendicular to the wall path. The DirectionSense applies as well. NOTE According to the [[IfcWallStandardCase]] material use definition the LayerSetDirection for [[IfcWallStandardCase]] is always AXIS2 that is, along the y axis , as shown in this example. Mls usage .. .. .. .. figures ifcmateriallayersetusage wall 01.png Figure 1 Material layer set usage for wall Figure 2 shows an example of the use of [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] aligned to a slab. EXAMPLE For a slab with perpendicular extruded geometric representation, the LayerSetDirection will coincide with the extrusion direction in positive or negative sense . In this example, the material layer set base is the extruded profile and consistent with the [[IfcExtrudedAreaSolid]].Position , with the DirectionSense being positive, the individual IfcMaterialLayers are built up from the base towards the positive z direction in this case. NOTE According to the [[IfcSlabStandardCase]] material use definition the LayerSetDirection for [[IfcSlabStandardCase]] is always AXIS3 that is, along the z axis . Mls usage .. .. .. .. figures ifcmateriallayersetusage slab 01.png Figure 2 Material layer set usage for slab Figure 3 shows an example of the use of [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] aligned to a roof slab with non perpendicular extrusion. EXAMPLE For a slab with non perpendicular extruded geometric representation, the guidelines above apply as well. The material layer thickness and the OffsetFromReferenceLine are always measured perpendicularly, even if the extrusion direction is not perpendicular. Therefore the total material layer thickness is not equal to the extrusion depth of the geometry.
