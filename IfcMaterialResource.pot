The location of material layer set shall be compatible with the building element geometry that is, material layers shall fit inside the element geometry . The rules to ensure the compatibility depend on the type of the building element. X 0D X 0D EXAMPLE S For a cavity brick wall with shape representation SweptSolid, the [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]].TotalThickness shall be equal to the wall thickness. Also the OffsetFromReferenceLine shall match the exact positions between the two shape representations of [[IfcWallStandardCase]] , that is the [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] s with RepresentationIdentifier Axis and RepresentationIdentifier Body . X 0D X 0D NOTE S Model view definitions or implementer agreements may provide more instructions on matching between building element geometry and material layer set usage. X 0D X 0D The [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] is always assigned to an individual occurrence object and only to relevant subtypes of [[IfcElement]] . The [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] , referenced by ForLayerSet , can however be shared among several occurrence objects. If the element type is available in other words, an instance of the relevant subtype of [[IfcElementType]] exists , then the [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] can be assigned to the element type.

X 0D X 0D .use head X 0D Attribute use definition X 0D X 0D The [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] is primarily intended to be associated with planar building elements having a constant thickness. With further agreements on the interpretation of LayerSetDirection , the usage can be extended also to other cases, for example to curved building elements, provided that the material layer thicknesses are constant. X 0D X 0D Generally, an element may be layered in any of its primary directions, denoted by its x, y or z axis. The geometry use definitions at each S specific type of building element will determine the applicable S LayerSetDirection . X 0D X 0D The following examples illustrate how the [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] attributes LayerSetDirection , DirectionSense , OffsetFromReferenceLine can be used in different cases. Normative material use definitions are documented at each element how these shall be used . X 0D X 0D Figure 1 shows an example of the use of [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] aligned to the axis of a wall. X 0D X 0D EXAMPLE For a standard wall with extruded geometric representation vertical extrusion , the layer set direction will be perpendicular to extrusion direction, and S can be derived from the direction of the wall axis. With the DirectionSense positive in this example the individual IfcMaterialLayers are assigned consecutively right to left or left to right. For a curved wall, direction denoting the wall thickness can be derived from the direction of the wall axis, and it will remain perpendicular to the wall path. The DirectionSense applies as well.

msgstr "An [[IfcCardinalPointReference]] is an index reference to significant points of a section profile. This index is used to describe the spatial relationship between the section of a member and a reference axis of the same member. X 0D X 0D HISTORY S New Type in IFC4. X 0D X 0D Indexes 1...9 refer to points at the bounding box of a profile. Indexes 10...19 refer to points defined by geometric centroid usually centre of gravity and shear centre, and their combinations with bounding box coordinates. In particular, the following index values are specified in this specification X 0D X 0D 1. bottom left X 0D 2. bottom centre X 0D 3. bottom right X 0D 4. mid depth left X 0D 5. mid depth centre X 0D 6. mid depth right X 0D 7. top left X 0D 8. top centre X 0D 9. top right X 0D 10. geometric centroid X 0D 11. bottom in line with the geometric centroid X 0D 12. left in line with the geometric centroid X 0D 13. right in line with the geometric centroid X 0D 14. top in line with the geometric centroid X 0D 15. shear centre X 0D 16. bottom in line with the shear centre X 0D 17. left in line with the shear centre X 0D 18. right in line with the shear centre X 0D 19. top in line with the shear centre X 0D 20.
