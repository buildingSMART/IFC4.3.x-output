Notes [[IfcMirroredProfileDef]] is primarily useful together with [[IfcCShapeProfileDef]] , [[IfcLShapeProfileDef]] , [[IfcUShapeProfileDef]] , or [[IfcZShapeProfileDef]] as parent profile but can be used with other parent profile types as well. Mirroring of an [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] is performed after translation and rotation according to its Position attribute. For example, if the parent profile s Position offsets it by half of its width to the right, then the mirrored profile will be offset by half of its width to the left. Mirroring about the x axis, i.e. swapping top and bottom, can be achieved by mirroring about the y axis coupled with 180 degree rotation about the z axis. In general, rotation happens in a containing object such as [[IfcSweptAreaSolid]] , i.e. after mirroring by [[IfcMirroredProfileDef]] was performed. If the parent profile is an [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] , rotation can alternatively happen already in the parent profile by means of its Position attribute, i.e. before mirroring by [[IfcMirroredProfileDef]] was performed.

msgstr "IfcProfileDef"

msgid "IfcProfileDef_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcProfileDef]] is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry. Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters. Arbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries. Derived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available. In addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile. HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Changed from ABSTRACT to non abstract for uses which do not require an explicitly defined geometry. Added inverse attributes HasProperties and HasExternalReference . Use in material association Beams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition, by means of [[IfcRelAssociatesMaterial]] together with [[IfcMaterialProfileSet]] and [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] . This way, building elements and element types with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and association. The profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with shape representations of the respective building elements. A higher level description of spatial aligment of the section profile of a member such as centered, bottom left, in the geometric centroid, and more can be provided within [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] by means of a cardinal point reference. This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent. Use in shape models Profile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or sectioned spines. The purpose of the profile definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define a uniform cross section being swept along a line extrusion using [[IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion]] or [[IfcExtrudedAreaSolid]] along a circular arc revolution using [[IfcSurfaceOfRevolution]] or [[IfcRevolvedAreaSolid]] along a directrix lying on a reference surface using [[IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid]] The purpose of the profile definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype [[IfcDerivedProfileDef]] is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the identity of vertices and edges. NOTE Subtypes of the [[IfcProfileDef]] contain parameterized profiles as subtypes of [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given by explicit curve geometry either open or closed profiles and two special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a 2D Cartesian transformation. An [[IfcProfileDef]] is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to AREA. An [[IfcProfileDef]] is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this case, the inside of the profile if the curve is closed is not part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to CURVE. Figure 1 illustrates use of parameterized profiles within a swept area solid. Position The [[IfcProfileDef]] is defined within the underlying coordinate system which is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of [[IfcSweptSurface]].Position or of [[IfcSweptAreaSolid]].Position or of each list member of [[IfcSectionedSpine]].CrossSectionPositions. In the figure to the left, the z axis of the position coordinate system points outwards of the drawing plane. Note The subtype [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] optionally provides an additional 2D position coordinate system relative to the underlying coordinate system of the [[IfcProfileDef]]. Sweeping In the later use of the [[IfcProfileDef]] within the swept surface or swept area solid, e.g. the [[IfcExtrudedAreaSolid]] here used as an example , the profile boundaries here based on the 2D position coordinate system of [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] are placed within the xy plane of the 3D position coordinate system of the swept surface or swept area solid. The profile is inserted into the underlying coordinate system either directly in case of using [[IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef]] and [[IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef]], through an intermediate position coordinate system in case of using [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]]. through an 2D Cartesian transformation operator applied directly to the curve position when using arbitrary profile definitions, or applied to the position coordinate system when using parameterized profile definitions in case of using [[IfcDerivedProfileDef]]. when using [[IfcCompositeProfileDef]] the insertion depends on the subtype of the included sub profiles. Figure 1 Profile sweeping Profile types Results of the different usage of the ProfileType attribute are demonstrated here. The ProfileType defines whether the inside the bounded area is part of the profile definition Area or not Curve . Figure 2 illustrates the resulting area or curve depending on ProfileType . ProfileType AREA ProfileType CURVE Figure 2 Profile types Profile specification by external reference If the profile is standardized by a norm or a catalogue, a reference to this norm or catalogue should be provided by means of HasExternalReference . This inverse relationship is used to associate an [[IfcExternalReference]] notably [[IfcClassificationReference]] or [[IfcLibraryReference]] with the profile. [[IfcClassificationReference]] is used to refer to a profile norm a common standard or manufacturer s standard . In this case, [[IfcClassificationReference]].ItemReference contains the formal profile designation from the norm. On the other hand, [[IfcProfileDef]].ProfileName contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation. [[IfcClassificationReference]].Name carries the short name of the profile norm. Optionally, the norm can be further described by [[IfcClassificationReference]].ReferencedSource . [[IfcLibraryReference]] is used to refer to a library which contains profile definitions. In this case, [[IfcLibraryReference]].ItemReference contains the identifier of the profile within the library and is meant to be machine readable in contrast to [[IfcProfileDef]].ProfileName which should be human readable . [[IfcLibraryReference]].Location and . Name or . ReferencedLibrary further describe the library. If an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the referenced classification or library. Direct instances of [[IfcProfileDef]] Usually, only subtypes of [[IfcProfileDef]] should be instantiated. In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes other than geometric models e.g. for structural analysis models , it may be possible to directly instantiate [[IfcProfileDef]] and further specify the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter are tracked by the inverse attribute HasProperties ."
