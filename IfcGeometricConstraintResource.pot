msgstr "[[IfcConnectionVolumeGeometry]] is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the physical connection or overlap of two objects at a volume defined by a solid or closed shell. It is envisioned as a control that applies to the element connection or interference relationships. The [[IfcSolidModel]] or the [[IfcClosedShell]] at the VolumeOnRelatingElement attribute defines the volume where the basic geometry items of the interfering elements overlap. The volume geometry and coordinates are provided within the local coordinate system of the RelatingElement , as specified at the subtypes of the relationship [[IfcRelConnects]] that utilizes the [[IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry]] . Optionally, the same S volume geometry and coordinates can also be provided within the local coordinate system of the RelatedElement by using the VolumeOnRelatedElement attribute.

msgid "IfcGridAxis_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An individual axis, [[IfcGridAxis]] , is defined in the context of a design grid. The axis definition is based on a curve of dimensionality 2. The grid axis is positioned within the XY plane of the position coordinate system defined by the [[IfcGrid]] . The standard geometric representation of [[IfcGridAxis]] is defined using a 2D curve entity. Grid axes are normally defined by an offset to another axis. The [[IfcOffsetCurve2D]] supports this concept. Each grid axis has a sense given by the parameterization of the curve. The attribute SameSense is an indicator of whether or not the sense of the grid axis agrees with, or opposes, that of the underlying curve. As shown in Figure 1, the grid axis is defined as a 2D curve within the xy plane of the position coordinate system. Any curve can be used to define a grid axis, most common is the use of [[IfcLine]] for linear grids and [[IfcCircle]] for radial grids. Most grids are defined by a pair of axis lists, each defined by a base grid axis and axes given by an offset to the base axis. The use of [[IfcOffsetCurve2D]] as underlying AxisCurve supports this concept. Figure 1 Grid axis HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0 bSI Documentation"

The location of the object coordinate system is given by the attribute PlacementLocation . It is defined as an [[IfcVirtualGridIntersection]] , that is, an intersection between two grid axes with optional offsets. The axis direction of the x axis of the object coordinate system is given either PlacementRefDirection NIL by the tangent of the first grid axis PlacementLocation.IntersectingAxes 1 at the virtual intersection maybe using the offset curve, if PlacementLocation.OffsetDistances is given PlacementRefDirection [[IfcDirection]] by the explicitly provided direction information PlacementRefDirection [[IfcVirtualGridIntersection]] by the tangent between the virtual grid intersection of PlacementLocation and the virtual grid intersection of PlacementRefDirection .

The following conventions shall apply as default relative positions if the relative placement is used. The conventions are given for all five direct subtypes of [[IfcProduct]] , the [[IfcSpatialStructureElement]] , [[IfcElement]] , [[IfcAnnotation]] , [[IfcGrid]] , [[IfcPort]] .

msgid "IfcVirtualGridIntersection_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcVirtualGridIntersection]] defines the derived location of the intersection between two grid axes. Offset values may be given to set an offset distance to the grid axis for the calculation of the virtual grid intersection. The two intersecting axes IntersectingAxes define the intersection point, which exact location in terms of the Cartesian point representing the intersection has to be calculated from the geometric representation of the two participating curves. NOTE The [[IfcGrid]] local placement, that can be provided relative to the local placement of another spatial structure element, has to be taken into account for calculating the absolute placement of the [[IfcVirtualGridIntersection]] . Where rules and informal rules ensure, that the IntersectingAxes belong to the same [[IfcGrid]] Offset values may be given OffsetDistances . If given, the position within the list of OffsetDistances corresponds with the position within the list of IntersectingAxes . Therefore OffsetDistances 1 sets the offset to IntersectingAxes 1 , OffsetDistances 2 sets the offset to IntersectingAxes 2 , and OffsetDistances 3 sets the offset to the virtual intersection in direction of the orientation of the cross product of IntersectingAxes 1 and the orthogonal complement of the IntersectingAxes 1 which is the positive or negative direction of the z axis of the design grid position . The following figures explain the usage of the OffsetDistances and IntersectingAxes attributes. Figure 1 illustrates two offset distances given where the virtual intersection is defined in the xy plane of the grid axis placement. Figure 1 Virtual grid intersection with two offsets Figure 2 illustrates three offset distances given where the virtual intersection is defined by an offset in direction of the z axis of the design grid placement to the virtual intersection in the xy plane of the grid axis placement. Figure 2 Virtual grid intersection with three offsets The distance of the offset curve OffsetDistances n is measured from the basis curve. The distance may be positive, negative or zero. A positive value of distance defines an offset in the direction which is normal to the curve in the sense of an anti clockwise rotation through 90 degrees from the tangent vector T at the given point. This is in the direction of orthogonal complement T . This can be reverted by the SameSense attribute at [[IfcGridAxis]] which may switch the sense of the AxisCurve . Figure 3 illustrates an example of a negative offset where the figure shows the side of the offset. IntersectingAxes 1 .AxisCurve is an [[IfcTrimmedCurve]] with an [[IfcCircle]] as BasisCurve and SenseAgreement TRUE. IntersectingAxes 1 .SameSense TRUE.
