msgid "IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegmentCLOTHOID"
msgstr "Clothoid"

msgid "IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegmentCLOTHOID_DEFINITION"
msgstr "In the geometric perspective, a clothoid denotes a connection between two points where the radius of curvature changes along the segment at a constant rate. The clothoid was an early achievement of geometry, also known as Euler's spiral or Cornu's spiral. It became very popular in road and rail design even before the widespread availability of computers because of the availability of tabulations of the normalized clothoid. Proper application of the so called clothoid constant provided fast solutions for all relevant parameters necessary to integrate clothoid segments between two consecutive segments with constant curvature. In most cases the clothoid smooths the curvature between a straight line and a circular arc.In the dynamic perspective, it denotes a segment with constant rate of lateral acceleration change induced by the curvature. The kinematic properties of the clothoid both reduce the exerted forces on the track by a train, improve the travel experience of train passengers and also reduce the stress of a car driver by avoiding sudden movements of the steering wheel.The kinematic advantages of the clothoid as a smoothing segment are true also for all the other transition bends currently in use.Base formula (Curvature)$$ \displaylines"

It is now widely accepted in relevant science and engineering that the linear change of the clothoid induces unwanted kinematic influences to a running train at speeds higher than 125 km/h.In the geometry perspective the Helmert segment is the assembly of two parts of same length which mirror the same change in radius of curvature.

msgid "IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegmentVIENNESEBEND_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The Viennese Bend (R) is an innovative track geometry transition element. Instead of analyzing the vehicle movement at the track plane the optimization efforts target a gravity center line at a defined height above the rails.As a consequence the path of the horizontal alignment center line is also influenced by the cant layout. The first part of the curvature formula is assembled from the basic function like the other transition bends. The additional term contains the bank angle "ψ" and the gravity center line height "h" and is unique to the Viennes Bend (R). This term causes a small movement contrary to the main direction in the x,y layout.Curvature formula$$ \displaylines"
