For example, if the object placement defines a z axis which is upright like the [[IfcProject]]'s world coordinate system, then the self weight coefficients would typically be [0.,0.,-1.] in a load case of dead loads with self weight.The overall coefficient in the inherited attribute Coefficient shall not be applied to SelfWeightCoefficients of the same instance of [[IfcStructuralLoadCase]].
