msgstr "Technical note: Because this class is a 'Predefined Type' in IFC, meaning a specialisation of its parent class, in IFC it should be represented by the parent class, with all the relevant properties and attributes."

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceMemberSHELL"
msgstr "Shell"

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceMemberSHELL_DEFINITION"
msgstr "A member with capacity to carry in-plane and out-of-plane loads, i.e. a combination of bending element and membrane element."

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceReactionBILINEAR_DESCRIPTION"
msgstr "Technical note: Because this class is a 'Predefined Type' in IFC, meaning a specialisation of its parent class, in IFC it should be represented by the parent class, with all the relevant properties and attributes."

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceReactionBILINEAR"
msgstr "Bilinear"

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceReactionBILINEAR_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The load value is bilinearly distributed over the load's extent."

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceReactionCONST_DESCRIPTION"
msgstr "Technical note: Because this class is a 'Predefined Type' in IFC, meaning a specialisation of its parent class, in IFC it should be represented by the parent class, with all the relevant properties and attributes."

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceReactionCONST"
msgstr "Const"

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceReactionCONST_DEFINITION"

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceReactionISOCONTOUR_DESCRIPTION"
msgstr "Technical note: Because this class is a 'Predefined Type' in IFC, meaning a specialisation of its parent class, in IFC it should be represented by the parent class, with all the relevant properties and attributes."

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceReactionISOCONTOUR"
msgstr "Isocontour"

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceReactionISOCONTOUR_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The load is specified by a series of iso-curves (level sets), i.e. curves at which the load value is constant. These curves run perpendicularly to the load gradient."
