Object definitions can be named, using the inherited Name attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited Description attribute. A context is a specific kind of object definition as it provides the project or library context in which object types and object occurrences are defined.Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are five essential kinds of relationships in which object definitions (by their instantiable subtypes) can be involved: Assignment of other objects - an assignment relationship ([[IfcRelAssigns]]) that refers to other types of objects and creates a bi-directional association. The semantic of the assignment is established at the level of the subtypes of the general [[IfcRelAssigns]] relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment.; Association to external resources - an association relationship ([[IfcRelAssociates]]) that refers to external sources of information (most notably a classification or document) and creates a uni-directional association. There is no dependency implied by the association.; Aggregation of other objects - an aggregation relationship ([[IfcRelAggregates]]) that establishes an unordered, spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.; Nesting of other objects - a nesting relationship ([[IfcRelNests]]) that establishes an ordered, non-spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.; Declaration within a context - a relationship ([[IfcRelDeclares]]) of the uppermost object definition within the object definition tree (e.g. the summary object within an object nesting tree) to the context (a project or project library). It applies the units, representation context and other context information to this object definition and all dependent ones."

msgstr "Pre Defined Property Set"

msgid "IfcPreDefinedPropertySet_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcPreDefinedPropertySet]] is a generalization of all statically defined property sets that are assigned to an object or type object. The statically or pre-defined property sets are entities with a fixed list of attributes having particular defined data types.Property sets are related to other objects by using the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object: Occurrence Object: [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] using the inverse attribute DefinesOccurrence.; Type Object: using a direct link by inverse attribute DefinesType.[[IfcPreDefinedPropertySet]]'s can be assigned to objects and object types but do not have a defining property set template."

msgid "IfcProcess"
msgstr "Process"

msgid "IfcProcess_DEFINITION"

An [[IfcProcess]] can be an activity (or task), or an event. It takes usually place in building construction with the intent of designing, costing, acquiring, constructing, or maintaining products or other and similar tasks or procedures.."

msgstr "Product"

msgid "IfcProduct_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The [[IfcProduct]] is an abstract representation of any object that relates to a geometric or spatial context. An [[IfcProduct]] occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an IfcProductDefinitionShape being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items).Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype [[IfcElement]]) and spatial items (covered by the subtype [[IfcSpatialElement]]) the [[IfcProduct]] also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.Any instance of [[IfcProduct]] defines a particular occurrence of a product. The common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of [[IfcProduct]], is handled by the [[IfcTypeProduct]] (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of [[IfcProduct]] by using the objectified relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByType]]. The [[IfcTypeProduct]] may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences."

msgid "IfcRelationship"
msgstr "Relationship"

msgid "IfcRelationship_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcRelationship]] is the abstract generalization of all objectified relationships in IFC. Objectified relationships are the preferred way to handle relationships among objects. This allows to keep relationship specific properties directly at the relationship and opens the possibility to later handle relationship specific behavior.There are two different types of relationships, 1-to-1 relationships and 1-to-many relationships, used within the subtypes of [[IfcRelationship]]. The following convention applies to all subtypes: The two sides of the objectified relationship are named Relating+ and Related+ ; In case of the 1-to-many relationship, the related side of the relationship shall be an aggregate being a set 1: N"

msgid "IfcRelDefinesByObject_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The objectified relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] defines the relationship between an object taking part in an object type decomposition and an object occurrence taking part in an occurrence decomposition of that type.The [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] is a 1-to-N relationship, as it allows for the assignment of one declaring object information to a single or to many reflected objects. Those objects then share the same object property sets and, for subtypes of [[IfcProduct]], the eventually assigned representation maps.Only objects that take part in a type decomposition and in an occurrence decomposition of the same type can be connected by the [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] relationship. The [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] links the decomposed object type part, also called the "declaring part" with the occurrence of that part inside the occurrence of the decomposed type, also called the "reflected part",..

msgid "IfcResource_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcResource]] contains the information needed to represent the costs, schedule, and other impacts from the use of a thing in a process. It is not intended to use [[IfcResource]] to model the general properties of the things themselves, while an optional linkage from [[IfcResource]] to the things to be used can be specified (specifically, the relationship from subtypes of [[IfcResource]] to [[IfcProduct]] through the [[IfcRelAssignsToResource]] relationship).There are two basic intended uses of [[IfcResource]]. First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of [[IfcResource]], or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn't have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of [[IfcResource]] (or its subtypes) alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project."
