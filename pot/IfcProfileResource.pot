For example, if the parent profile's Position offsets it by half of its width to the right, then the mirrored profile will be offset by half of its width to the left.Mirroring about the x axis, i.e. swapping top and bottom, can be achieved by mirroring about the y axis coupled with 180 degree rotation about the z axis. In general, rotation happens in a containing object such as IfcSweptAreaSolid, i.e. after mirroring by [[IfcMirroredProfileDef]] was performed. If the parent profile is an [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]], rotation can alternatively happen already in the parent profile by means of its Position attribute, i.e. before mirroring by [[IfcMirroredProfileDef]] was performed."

It can be used to position the profile at any point which becomes the origin [0.,0.,0.] of the extruded or rotated surface or solid.The Position attribute should not be used if the transformation can be specified in a containing object instead. In particular, this applies if the [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] is referenced as SweptArea in subtypes of IfcSweptAreaSolid or as CrossSections in IfcSectionedSpine.Several subtypes of [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] provide shape parameters which are optional.
