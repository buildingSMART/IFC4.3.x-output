msgid "IfcPerformanceHistory"
msgstr "Performance History"

msgid "IfcPerformanceHistory_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcPerformanceHistory]] is used to document the actual performance of an occurrence instance over time. It includes machine-measured data from building automation systems and human-specified data such as task and resource usage. The data may represent actual conditions, predictions, or simulations.The realtime data tracked by performance history takes the form of property sets where all properties are based on time series. Unlike design-based data at occurrences and types, performance-driven data is time-sensitive and may change in realtime by some measurement device. Data may be captured at irregular intervals such as when values change beyond established thresholds, or at regular intervals of specified duration."

msgid "LifeCyclePhase"
msgstr "Life Cycle Phase"

msgid "LifeCyclePhase_DEFINITION"
msgstr "Describes the applicable building life-cycle phase. Typical values should be DESIGNDEVELOPMENT, SCHEMATICDEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTIONDOCUMENT, CONSTRUCTION, ASBUILT, COMMISSIONING, OPERATION, etc."

msgid "IfcRelAssociatesApproval"
msgstr "Rel Associates Approval"

msgid "IfcRelAssociatesApproval_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The entity [[IfcRelAssociatesApproval]] is used to apply approval information defined by IfcApproval, in IfcApprovalResource schema, to subtypes of [[IfcRoot]]."

msgid "IfcRelAssociatesConstraint"
msgstr "Rel Associates Constraint"

msgid "IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The entity [[IfcRelAssociatesConstraint]] is used to apply constraint information defined by IfcConstraint, in the IfcConstraintResource schema, to subtypes of [[IfcRoot]]."

msgid "Intent"
msgstr "Intent"

msgid "Intent_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The intent of the constraint usage with regard to its related IfcConstraint and [[IfcObject]], [[IfcPropertyDefinition]] or [[IfcRelationship]] entities. Typical values can be e.g. RATIONALE or EXPECTED PERFORMANCE."
