msgid "IfcConstraint_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcConstraint]] is used to define a constraint or limiting value or boundary condition that may be applied to an object or to the value of a property. Constraints may be subdivided into user defined constraints and system defined constraints. User defined constraints are applied by a user and are restricted to high level definitions such as object properties. System defined constraints may apply to any object attribute, are typically defined by an application to enforce data validation or parametric behavior, and are intended to be enforced by applications but not to be directly editable by an end user. [[IfcConstraint]] may be associated with any subtype of [[IfcObjectDefinition]] or [[IfcPropertyDefinition]] through the [[IfcRelAssociatesConstraint]] relationship to indicate a system defined constraint, or may be associated with [[IfcResourceObjectSelect]] such as [[IfcPropertySingleValue]] by [[IfcResourceConstraintRelationship]] to indicate a user defined constraint. A constraint must have a name applied through the [[IfcConstraint]].Name attribute and optionally, a description through [[IfcConstraint]].Description . The grade of the constraint hard, soft, advisory must be specified through [[IfcConstraint]].ConstraintGrade or [[IfcConstraint]].UserDefinedGrade whilst the source, creating actor and time at which the constraint is created may be optionally asserted through [[IfcConstraint]].ConstraintSource , [[IfcConstraint]].CreatingActor and [[IfcConstraint]].CreationTime . A constraint may also have additional external information such as classification or document information associated to it by [[IfcExternalReferenceRelationship]] , accessible through inverse attribute [[IfcConstraint]].HasExternalReferences HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0 .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE CreationTime changed to [[IfcDateTime]] for ISO 8601 representation, HasExternalReferences new inverse attribute. bSI Documentation"
