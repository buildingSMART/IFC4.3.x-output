X 0D X 0D [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] defines elements of a building automation control system.

The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows X 0D X 0D Impart control over flow control elements [[IfcFlowController]] in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation [[IfcActuator]] . X 0D Sensing elements [[IfcSensor]] that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow. X 0D Controllers [[IfcController]] typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control. X 0D X 0D Since [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] , the objectified relationship [[IfcRelFlowControlElements]] has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required. X 0D X 0D The key distinction between [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] and [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between [[IfcFlowMeter]] subtype of [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] measuring a flow quantity and [[IfcFlowInstrument]] subtype of [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] measuring a flow quality , is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures having inlet outlet pipes for the measured substance follows the [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] hierarchy and therefore [[IfcFlowMeter]] which measures the flow internally . Otherwise, if it monitors controls but does not connect inline within the flow system it is external or is a component of another device , then it follows the [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] hierarchy and therefore [[IfcFlowInstrument]] which may display various attributes through connected sensors .
