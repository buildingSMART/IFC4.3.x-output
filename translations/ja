msgstr "An [[IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid]] is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping an area along a Directrix . The swept area is provided by a subtype of [[IfcProfileDef]] . The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees to the start tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile s x axis agrees to the orthogonal projection of the FixedReference direction within the plane of start tangent and Fixed Reference . The orientation of the curve during the sweeping operation is controlled by the FixedReference direction. X 0D X 0D The SweptArea is swept along the Directrix in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system used to define the SweptArea is on the Directrix and the local x axis is in the direction of the projection of FixedReference onto the normal plane to the directrix at this point. The resulting solid has the property that the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the Directrix at any point is a copy of the SweptArea . The resulting swept solid is placed by the Position coordinate system. X 0D X 0D The Directrix and the ReferenceSurface are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the StartParam , being either the parameter value based on the curve parameterization, or by a length measured along the directrix from its beginning. If no StartParam is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the EndParam , being either the parameter value based on the curve parameterization, or by a length measured along the directrix from its beginning.

The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees to the tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile s x axis agrees to the surface normal. At any point along the directrix, the swept profile origin lies on the directrix, the profile s normal points towards the tangent of the directrix, and the profile s x axis is identical to the surface normal at this point. X 0D X 0D NOTE The profile area s normal has to be identical to the tangent of the directrix at any given point. In case of a directrix having a linear segment at the start point, the segment has to be perpendicular to the profile at start. X 0D X 0D The Directrix and the ReferenceSurface are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the StartParam , the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no StartParam is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the EndParam , the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no EndParam is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix. The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the Directrix . X 0D X 0D NOTE The StartParam and the EndParam are not normalized by default, they depend upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the [[IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment]] within an [[IfcCompositeCurve]] as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve. In case of a closed curve, such as [[IfcCircle]] or [[IfcEllipse]] , as the directrix, StartParam and the EndParam shall not exceed the parametic range, they shall not be 360 . X 0D X 0D EXAMPLE The reference surface is any surface plane, cylindric, composite situated in 3D space and positioned in the object coordinate system. In most cases, it is a plane or a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, in case of a plane it might be defined as a polyline or composite curve, in case of a cylindrical or other non planer reference surface it might often be defined as a p curve on this reference surface. X 0D X 0D At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system of the implicit plane lies at the directrix. The Axis3 the z axis, or normal of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 the x axis, or u of the position coordinate system is identical to the normal of the reference surface at this point. The Axis2 the y axis, or v is constructed. X 0D X 0D The resulting body of the swept solid is not repositioned if the inherited Position attribute is omitted.

msgstr "The [[IfcTessellatedFaceSet]] is a boundary representation topological model limited to planar faces and straight edges. It may represent an approximation of an analytical surface or solid that may be provided in addition to its tessellation as a separate shape representation. The [[IfcTessellatedFaceSet]] provides a compact data representation of an connected face set using indices into ordered lists of vertices, normals, colours, and texture maps. X 0D X 0D NOTE The compact representation has been chosen to enable small data sets despite potentially large sets of faces, edges and vertices needed to represent tessellations of analyticals surfaces and solids, and despite large sets of colour and texture information to annotate the tessellated faces. X 0D X 0D The [[IfcTessellatedFaceSet]] is an abstract supertype of tesselated face sets each imposing specific constraints on face generation for tessellation, such as triangulation with or without strip and fans , or quadrilaterals, or polygonal faces with or without inner loops .

X 0D X 0D The following attributes apply to all subtypes X 0D X 0D The Coordinates are the ordered list of Cartesian points representing the vertices of the tessellated item. An index list, defined at the level of subtypes, uses the points, identified by index position, to construct the polylines that represent the faces.

Depending on the value of the attribute Closed the instance of [[IfcTriangulatedFaceSet]] represents X 0D X 0D if TRUE, a boundary represention or B rep X 0D if FALSE, a face based surface representation. X 0D X 0D The coordinates of each point are provided by a one based index into an ordered list of Cartesian points provided by the two dimensional list CoordIndex , where X 0D X 0D the first dimension of the two dimensional list addresses the list of triangular faces X 0D the second dimension of the two dimensional list provides exactly three indices.

X 0D X 0D NOTE In case of a body representation having triangular faces with curvature, different normals for all three vertices in context of this triangles are exported, describing the curvature for smooth visualisation. In case of triangular faces with no curvature, the three vertex based normals are identical and could always be computed from the face. Therefore vertices should only be exported to support smooth visualisation by curvature of triangles. In case of faceted representation no vertices should be exported.
