msgid "IfcGroup_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcGroup]] is an generalization of any arbitrary group. A group is a logical collection of objects. It does not have its own position, nor can it hold its own shape representation. Therefore a group is an aggregation under some non geometrical topological grouping aspects. EXAMPLE An example for a group is a system, since it groups elements under the aspect of their role, regardless of their position in a building. One of the most important usage of a group representing a system is the [[IfcDistributionSystem]] , that groups distribution components, such as space heaters and valves into a heating system. A group can hold any collection of objects, the relationship [[IfcRelAssignsToGroup]] is used to establish the group collection. Objects within a group are S products, processes, controls, resources, actors or other groups, thus groups can be nested. An object can be part of zero, one, or many groups. Grouping relationships are not required to be hierarchical nor do they imply a dependency. Groups are assigned to other objects such as a process or a resource by the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object Process assigned using [[IfcRelAssignsToProcess]] Resource assigned using [[IfcRelAssignsToResource]] Controls affecting the group using [[IfcRelAssignsToControl]] A group can be exchanged without having already objects within the group collection. [[IfcGroup]] does not define an own object coordinate system, nor does it have an independent shape representation. NOTE Use [[IfcRelAggregates]] together with the appropriate subtypes of [[IfcProduct]] to define an aggregation of products that may have its own position and shape representation. This relationship shall be used to create a product breakdown structure.

NOTE Examples of [[IfcObject]] include physically tangible items such as wall, beam or covering, physically existing items such as spaces, or conceptual items such as grids or virtual boundaries. It also stands for processes such as work tasks, for controls such as cost items, or for actors such as persons involved in the design process. Objects can be named, using the inherited Name attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrance. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited Description attribute. The ObjectType attribute is used to store the user defined value for all subtypes of [[IfcObject]] , where a PredefinedType attribute is given, and its value is set to USERDEFINED. to provide a type information could be seen as a very lightweight classifier of the subtype of [[IfcObject]] , if no PredefinedType attribute is given. This is often the case, if no comprehensive list of predefined types is available. Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are several relationships in which objects can be involved Association to external internal resource information an association relationship that refers to external internal sources of information. See supertype [[IfcObjectDefinition]] for more information. Assignment of other objects an assignment relationship that refers to other types of objects. See supertype [[IfcObjectDefinition]] for more information. Aggregation of other objects an aggregation relationship that establishes a whole part relation. Objects can either be a whole, or a part, or both. See supertype [[IfcObjectDefinition]] for more information. Assignment of a type IsTypedBy a definition relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] that uses a type definition to define the common characteristics of this occurrences, potentially including the common shape representation and common properties of all object occurrences assigned to this type. It is a specific occurrence relationship with implied dependencies as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them . Assignment of a partial type IsDeclaredBy , Declares a definition relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] that uses a component of a type definition a part of a type, called the declaring part to define a component of an occurence part of occurrence, called the reflected part . This is also refered to as a deep copy . The common characteristics of all parts in the occurrence are defined by parts in the type. It is a specific occurrence relationship with implied dependencies as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them . Assignment of property sets IsDefinedBy a definition relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] that assignes property set definitions to the object occurrence. NOTE See [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] for an explanatory figure. Also see there for how to override type properties by occurrence properties. See [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] for an explanatory figure for the assignment of a partial type.

A context is a specific kind of object definition as it provides the project or library context in which object types and object occurrences are defined. Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information.

msgid "IfcProduct_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The [[IfcProduct]] is an abstract representation of any object that relates to a geometric or spatial context. An [[IfcProduct]] occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an [[IfcProductDefinitionShape]] being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation with or without underlying geometry of the topological items . Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects referred to as elements for incorporation into an AEC FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations. In addition to physical products covered by the subtype [[IfcElement]] and spatial items covered by the subtype [[IfcSpatialElement]] the [[IfcProduct]] also includes non physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc. Any instance of [[IfcProduct]] defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar or identical occurrences of [[IfcProduct]] , is handled by the [[IfcTypeProduct]] and its subtypes , assigned to one or many occurrences of [[IfcProduct]] by using the objectified relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] . The [[IfcTypeProduct]] may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences. NOTE See [[IfcTypeProduct]] for how to use a common geometric representation and [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] for using and overriding common properties.

Property set template [[IfcPropertySetTemplate]] , a collection of property templates that determine the definition of properties used within a project context. Property template [[IfcPropertyTemplate]] , a single template that determines the definition of a particular property used in the same project context.

The decomposition relationship denotes a whole part hierarchy with the ability to navigate from the whole the composition to the parts and vice versa. Decompositions may be constrained by requiring both, the whole and its parts, to be of the same type thus establishing a nesting relationship. Or they may require some form of physical containment, thus establishing special types of aggregation relationships. NOTE There are two special names for decomposition, which are linguistically distinguished, nesting and aggregation. The subtypes of [[IfcRelDecomposes]] will introduce either the nesting or aggregation convention see [[IfcRelNests]] and [[IfcRelAggregates]] . EXAMPLE A cost element is a nest of other cost elements. Or a structural frame is an aggregation of beams and columns. Both are applications of decomposition relationship. Decompositions imply a dependency, i.e. the definition of the whole depends on the definition of the parts and the parts depend on the existence of the whole. The decomposition relationship can be applied in a recursive manner, i.e. a decomposed element can be part in another decomposition. Cyclic references have to be prevented at application level.

All properties for all object occurrences of a common object type have the same value then only the object type definition has a property set assigned. 2. All properties for all object occurrences are different, that is there are no common property values for the object type definition then each of the object occurrence has a property set assigned. 3. Some properties within the same property set have common values and are assigned to the object type definition and some are occurrence specific and assigned with potentially different values to the object occurrences then The sum of all properties within a given property set applicable to an object occurrence is the union of properties assigned to the object type definition plus the properties assigned to the object occurrence.

The nesting relationship can be applied to all non physical subtypes of object and object types, namely processes, controls like cost items , and resources. It can also be applied to physical subtypes of object and object types, namely elements having ports. The nesting implies an order among the nested parts. EXAMPLE A nesting of costs items in an [[IfcCostSchedule]] is the composition of complex cost items from other cost items. The order of the nested cost items underneath the parent cost item is determined by the order of the list of RelatedObjects . EXAMPLE A nesting of [[IfcTask]] s within a work schedule is the composition of a parent work task from more specific sub work tasks. The order of the sub tasks underneath the parent task is determined by the order of the list of RelatedObjects . EXAMPLE A series of [[IfcDistributionPort]] s can be nested within an [[IfcDistributionElement]] . They decompose the distribution element and have an implied order.

There are two basic intended uses of [[IfcResource]] . First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of [[IfcResource]] , or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn t have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of [[IfcResource]] or its subtypes alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project. EXAMPLE construction equipment such as earth moving vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of [[IfcResource]] alone. Second, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of [[IfcResource]] objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the [[IfcResource]] instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced.

msgid "IfcTypeObject_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The object type defines the specific information about a type, being common to all occurrences of this type. It refers to the specific level of the well recognized generic specific occurrance modeling paradigm. The [[IfcTypeObject]] gets assigned to the individual object instances the occurrences via the [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] relationship. NOTE The terms Type and Style are often used interchangeably. The object type is represented by a set of property set definitions. The attached property sets describe the available alpha numeric information about the object type. and are used to define all common properties that apply to all object occurrences of that type. NOTE If a property having having the same name is used within the [[IfcPropertySet]] assigned to an [[IfcTypeObject]] and subtypes and to an occurrence of that type, then the occurrence property overrides the type property. See [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] for an explanatory figure. Object types may be exchanged without being already assigned to objects. An object type may have an indication of the library or catalogue from which its definition originates. This association is handled by the inherited HasAssociations relationship pointing to [[IfcRelAssociatesLibrary]] . HISTORY New entity in IFC2x .change ifc2x3 IFC2x3 CHANGE The [[IfcTypeObject]] is now subtyped from the new supertype [[IfcObjectDefinition]] , and the attribute HasPropertySets has been changed from a LIST into a SET. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE The entity [[IfcTypeObject]] shall not be instantiated from IFC4 onwards.
