msgid "IfcAlignment_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An alignment is used to define a reference system to position elements mainly for linear construction works, such as roads, rails, bridges, and others. The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology. NOTE See ISO 19148 Geographic information Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing. A single alignment may have a horizontal alignment defined in the x y plane of the engineering coordinate system an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along z coordinate space a relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and or at constant or variable offsets a 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data. Alignments may be aggregated into referents [[IfcReferent]] or derivative alignments. Derivative alignments may be used to indicate dependent alignments, such as an alignment for a bridge that is relative to a parent alignment for a road, where the child [[IfcAlignment]] may have Axis set to [[IfcOffsetCurveByDistances]] that starts and ends at a span within the extent of the [[IfcAlignmentCurve]] defined at the Axis of the parent [[IfcAlignment]] . Alignments may be assigned to groups using [[IfcRelAssignsToGroup]] , where [[IfcGroup]] or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments. Supported representations of [[IfcAlignment]].Axis are [[IfcAlignmentCurve]] as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment represented by their alignment segments [[IfcAlignmentCurve]] as a 2D horizontal alignment represented by its horizontal alignment segments without a vertical alignment [[IfcOffsetCurveByDistances]] as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an [[IfcAlignmentCurve]] or another [[IfcOffsetCurveByDistances]] [[IfcPolyline]] as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation such as coming from a survey [[IfcPolyline]] as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation NOTE Although Axis is an [[IfcCurve]] base type, only derived types [[IfcAlignmentCurve]] , [[IfcOffsetCurveByDistances]] , and [[IfcPolyline]] are meant to be supported types. Derivative specifications Model View Definitions may expand this set to include additional curve types. bSI Documentation"

msgstr "IfcAnnotation"

msgid "IfcAnnotation_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An annotation is an information element within the geometric and spatial context of a project, that adds a note or meaning to the objects which constitutes the project model. Annotations include additional points, curves, text, dimensioning, hatching and other forms of graphical notes. It also includes virtual or symbolic representations of additional model components, not representing products or spatial structures, such as event elements, survey points, contour lines or similar. NOTE Additional presentation information often 2D such as tag number or hatching, that is directly related to a particular product representation is included within the [[IfcProductDefinitionShape]] having various [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] s of the [[IfcElement]] and its subtypes . Only those presentation information, that cannot be directly related to a single product, have to be wrapped within the [[IfcAnnotation]]. If available, the annotation should be related to the spatial context of the project, by containing the annotation within the appropriate level of the building structure site, facility, facility part or building, storey, or space . This is handled by the [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] relationship. The [[IfcAnnotation]] can provide specific 0D, 1D, and 2D geometric items as representation of the annotation, offering annotation point, curves, and surfaces. In addition to the predefined type values in [[IfcAnnotationTypeEnum]], the following values can be used for the ObjectType with PredefinedType attribute value USERDEFINED . Annotation point is an annotation provided by a point that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of point annotation, some suggested values are SurveyPoint A single survey point represented by a Cartesian point. A property set may add the conditions method, accuracy, etc. to the survey point . SurveyArea A set of survey points represented by Cartesian point. These coordinates are determined relative to the coordinates of a reference point, which acts as the datum for the survey. Properties attached apply equally to all points. The difference in elevation of the survey points enables terrain to be determined. Annotation curve is an annotation provided by a curve that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of curve annotation, some suggested values are ContourLine A line of constant elevation typically used on geographic maps where the spacing of lines at constant intervals of elevation may be used as an indication of slope. IsoBar A line of constant pressure typically used on weather maps or to show pressure gradient in spaces, chambers or externally. IsoLux A line of constant illumination typically used to show the distribution of illumination levels and or day lighting in a space or externally. IsoTherm A line of constant temperature typically used to show the distribution and effect of heating or cooling within a space or to show temperature distribution on a geographic map. Annotation surface is an annotation provided by a surface that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of surface annotation, some suggested values are SurveyArea A surface patch based on survey points. bSI Documentation"

EXAMPLE Examples of elements in a building construction context are walls, floors, windows and recesses. The elements can be logically contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a certain level within a project structure hierarchy site, building, storey or space . This is done by using the [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the [[IfcRelAssociatesMaterial]] and [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] relationship. In addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type and thereby be defined by the element type properties using the [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] relationship.

msgid "IfcElementQuantity_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcElementQuantity]] defines a set of derived measures of an element s physical property. Elements could be spatial structure elements like buildings, storeys, or spaces or building elements like walls, slabs, finishes . The [[IfcElementQuantity]] gets assigned to the element by using the [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] relationship. The optional MethodOfMeasurement attribute defines the code, e.g. from a standard method of measurement, which had been used to calculate the element quantity. NOTE The recognizable values for the name and the method of measurement attributes have to be agreed upon in further agreement documents, such as implementers agreements. Some of these agreements might be limited to a certain region, to which the method of measurement applies. The name attribute, given at the individual Quantities provides a recognizable semantic meaning of the element quantity. Both information is needed to establish a precise meaning for the measure value. An optional description may be assigned to each of the Quantities . All quantities assigned by a single instance of [[IfcElementQuantity]] are deemed to have been generated according to the same method of measurement. However several instances of [[IfcElementQuantity]] are assignable to an element, thus allowing for an element having quantities generated according to several methods of measurement. EXAMPLE To exchange the net floor area of spaces in the German region as [[IfcSpace]] , the name might be Netto Grundfläche net floor area , and the method of measurement might be accordingly DIN277 2 German industry norm no. 277 edition 2 . EXAMPLE The same instance of [[IfcSpace]] may have a different area measure assigned in the German region according to a housing regulation, the name would be Wohnfläche and the method of measurement would be 2.BV . It would be attached to the [[IfcSpace]] by a separate [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] relationship. The [[IfcElementQuantity]] can have the following subtypes of [[IfcPhysicalQuantity]] within its SET of Quantities , which count for the basis measure types used count measure weight measure length measure area measure volume measure time measure Base quantities are quantity definitions that are independent of a particular method of measurement and therefore internationally applicable. Base quantities are defined as gross and net values and provided by measurement of the correct geometric shape representation of the element. This specification includes a set of base quantity definition. See each subtype of [[IfcElement]] for applicable base quantities. The following general agreements apply for each base quantity set [[IfcElementQuantity]].Name [[IfcElementQuantity]].MethodOfMeasurement BaseQuantities [[IfcElementQuantity]].Quantities SET of subtypes of [[IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity]] with values for the Name attribute as published as part of this specifciation.

Openings can be inserted into walls, slabs, beams, columns, or other elements. The IFC specification provides two entities for opening elements [[IfcOpeningStandardCase]] is used for all openings that have a constant profile along a linear extrusion. They are placed relative to the voided elements and the extrusion direction is perpendicular to the plane of the element horizontally for walls, vertically for slabs . Only a single extrusion body is allowed. It cuts through the whole thickness of the voided element, i.e. it reflects a true opening. [[IfcOpeningElement]] is used for all other occurrences of openings and in particular also for niches or recesses. NOTE View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict the types of elements which can be voided by an [[IfcOpeningElement]] or [[IfcOpeningStandardCase]] There are two different types of opening elements an opening, where the thickness of the opening is greater or equal to the thickness of the element a recess or niche, where the thickness of the recess is smaller than the thickness of the element. The attribute PredefinedType should be used to capture the differences, the attribute is set to OPENING for an opening or the attribute is set to RECESS for a recess or niche. If the value for PredefinedType is omitted, or the value is set to NOTDEFINED, no specific information of whether it is an opening or recess shall be assumed. An [[IfcOpeningElement]] has to be inserted into an [[IfcElement]] by using the [[IfcRelVoidsElement]] relationship.

It is also used to connect a system to the relevant spatial element that it serves. NOTE The primary containment relationship between an element and the spatial structure is handled by [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]]. Any element can be referenced to zero, one or several levels of the spatial structure. Whereas the [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] relationship is required to be hierarchical an element can only be contained in exactly one spatial structure element , the [[IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure]] is not restricted to be hierarchical. EXAMPLE A wall might be normally contained within a storey, and since it does not span through several stories, it is not referenced in any additional storey. However a curtain wall might span through several stories, in this case it can be contained within the ground floor, but it would be referenced by all additional stories, it spans. Predefined spatial structure elements to which elements can be assigned are site as [[IfcSite]] facility as [[IfcFacility]] or its subtypes [[IfcBridge]], [[IfcBuilding]], [[IfcMarineFacility]], [[IfcRailway]] or [[IfcRoad]] part of facility as IfcFaciltityPart, or more specifically as [[IfcBuildingStorey]] or [[IfcSpace]] Elements can also be references in a spatial zone that is provided as [[IfcSpatialZone]].

In the case of a physical space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and the building element, providing the boundary, is referenced, In the case of a virtual space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and a virtual element is referenced. The [[IfcRelSpaceBoundary]] is defined as an objectified relationship that handles the element to space relationship by objectifying the relationship between an element and the space it bounds. It is given as a one to one relationship, but allows each element including virutal elements and openings to define many such relationship and each space to be defined by many such relationships. Space boundaries are always defined as seen from the space. In general two basic types of space boundaries are distinguished 1 st level space boundary defined as boundaries of the space, not taking into account any change in building element or spaces on the other side. 2 nd level space boundary defined as boundary taking any change in building element or spaces on the other side into account. It can be further distinguished into 2 nd level type A There is a space on the other side. 2 nd level type B There is a building element on the other side. The exact definition of how space boundaries are broken down depends on the view definition, more detailed conventions on how space boundaries are decomposed can only be given at the domain or application type level. In an architectural or FM related view, a space boundary is defined totally from inside the space. This is a 1st level space boundary.
