msgstr "[[IfcConstructionEquipmentResource]] is usage of construction equipment to assist in the performance of construction. Construction Equipment resources are wholly or partially consumed or occupied in the performance of construction. HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0. Occurrences of [[IfcConstructionEquipmentResource]] are products that are used as resources to assist the process of construction. More specifically, they are products that are standalone items brought to a project to fulfil a particular purpose. Examples might be a tower crane or other mobile crane, a screwing machine, or a lifting hoist. Instances of any subtype of [[IfcProduct]] may be assigned to the equipment resource using [[IfcRelAssignsToResource]] in order to characterize the equipment further, as described at the supertype [[IfcResource]] . Examples of relevant subtypes of [[IfcProduct]] are [[IfcTransportElement]] , [[IfcDiscreteAccessory]] , or [[IfcProxy]] for particular cases where more precise usage details are not available bSI Documentation"

The purpose of an [[IfcLaborResource]] is to identify a skillset that may be required or used.

It may be particularly useful when creating an overall plan for a process or processes.

msgstr "[[IfcSubContractResource]] is a construction resource needed in a construction process that represents a sub contractor. HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE The attribute SubContractor has been deleted use [[IfcRelAssignsToResource]] to assign an [[IfcActor]] to fulfill the role as the subcontractor. The attribute JobDescription has been deleted use LongDescription to describe the job. An [[IfcSubContractResource]] can be used in cost estimating and work planning with or without specifying the subcontractor and contract agreement. The purpose of an [[IfcSubContractResource]] is to indicate work of a particular type that is that is to be engaged through the use of a sub contract. Its aim is to identify the description of the sub contract work required. It can be used to identify the generic type of sub contract resource that is required for a purpose without having to be specific about the actor person or organization providing the resource occurrence. It may be particularly useful when creating an overall plan for a process or processes. For instance, within maintenance or work planning there may be a known task that needs to be done which is planned to require an insulation specialist . A subcontract resource may be described at various stages and levels of detail through its assignments Subcontract resource designated for particular tasks Actors identified to request bids Cost schedules bids received from actors Project order work order, change order, etc. executed bSI Documentation"
