msgstr "IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegmentTypeEnum"

msgid "IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegmentTypeEnum_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The [[IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegmentTypeEnum]] indicates the type of a segment of a horizontal alignment segment [[IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment]] . Horizontal segments can be viewed from a geometric perspective and from a kinematic perspective. In recent times the kinematic perspective gained importance. The enumerations are detailed according to this development especially in modern track design. Kinematic perspective on horizontal alignment segments The central parameter of the kinematic perspective is lateral acceleration of the vehicle induced by change of direction while driving. In the horizontal layout this is the represented by the curvature of the segment. According to the curvature value the following categorization can be made Curvature Segmenttype Enumeration Values 0 straight line LINE constant in the complete segment, 0 Circular arc CIRCULARARC variation along the segment Transition with linear curvature variation CLOTHOID, CUBIC variation along the segment Transition with non linear curvature variation HELMERTCURVE, BLOSSCURVE, COSINECURVE, SINECURVE, VIENNESEBEND Geometric perspective on horizontal alignment segments The traditional view is denoted by the geometric perspective in the context of the business terminology related [[IfcAlignment]] documentation. Before the availability of modern computers alignment design was performed using traditional drawing techniques. In the first phase of computerization this origin led to a representation in the x,y space first and a check of safety related properties in a second step. This can still be seen in regulations which have been put into effect 1980 or earlier. Of course designs which have been produced on basis of these regulations reflect the good enough attitude in the precision of the documentation. In a later phase an increasing importance of the kinematic perspective can be observed. Here precise control of the lateral acceleration horizontal and cant layout and vertical acceleration vertical layout became prevalent. Designers started to use high performance transition bends especially in high speed scenarios. In the kinematic perspective precise curvature fitting between consecutive segments needs to be better than in the good enough approach of traditional geometric perspective. Central terms are e.g. jerks , theoretical cant or cant deficiency . Generic calculation of intrinsic x, y coordinates for a given curvature For each horizontal alignment segment with a known curvature formula a generic method to calculate segment intrinsic coordinates exists. Double integration .. .. figures ifcalignmenthorizontalsegmenttypeenum curvature2coord.png Figure 1 Double integration of curvature yielding intrinsic coordinates NOTE While it is possible to apply the generic calculation also for trivial cases like LINE or CIRCULARARC it is much more efficient to use available formulas. Word of warning Good enough traditional designs have to be carefully checked before being included into a high precision 3D model. Intermediate corrections might be necessary. Fortunately the clothoid works very well with comparable documentation quality both in the classic geometric perspective and in the more recent kinematic perspective. Fortunately the vast majority of horizontal transition bends are designed and implemented as clothoids. Recommendation Check the relevant regulations for the network in question. Alignment designs as such are very stable over the lifetime of the road or track. Especially for old designs quality and precision of available documentation has to be checked very carefully. A clear understanding of limitations should be established before implementing automated data flows between high precision BIM environments and legacy documentation systems. This applies both to legacy, central databases and to legacy, individual documents.

Cubic formula for alignment Cubic transition .. .. figures ifcalignmenthorizontalsegmenttypeenum cubic.png Figure 2 Alignment formula for cubic Since the manual computation of cubics was considerable easier compared to the theoretically sound clothoid, cubic transistions became very popular as good enough replacement curves. Cubic transition bends can still be found in many legacy alignments based on earlier design regulations. There also exist regulations containing cubic transitions for new designs. It is obvious that simple approximations cannot fulfil all requirements for a kinematically correct track design. For example, the requirement of tangential continuity has often been neglected in favour of lower design costs by using sufficiently good cubic curves. The cubic is known in two variants as Cubic Parabola or Cubic Spiral setting either the sinus or the cosinus of the deflection angle to 0. HELMERTCURVE The Helmert curve or Helmert transition is an early example of a high performance transition bend. It is now widely accepted in relevant science and engineering that the linear change of the clothoid induces unwanted kinematic influences to a running train at speeds higher than 125 km h. In the geometry perspective the Helmert segment is the assembly of two parts of same length which mirror the same change in radius of curvature.

Any curve can be used to define a grid axis, most common is the use of [[IfcLine]] for linear grids and [[IfcCircle]] for radial grids.

msgid "IfcVirtualGridIntersection_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcVirtualGridIntersection]] defines the derived location of the intersection between two grid axes. Offset values may be given to set an offset distance to the grid axis for the calculation of the virtual grid intersection. The two intersecting axes IntersectingAxes define the intersection point, which exact location in terms of the Cartesian point representing the intersection has to be calculated from the geometric representation of the two participating curves. NOTE The [[IfcGrid]] local placement, that can be provided relative to the local placement of another spatial structure element, has to be taken into account for calculating the absolute placement of the [[IfcVirtualGridIntersection]] . Where rules and informal rules ensure, that the IntersectingAxes belong to the same [[IfcGrid]] Offset values may be given OffsetDistances . If given, the position within the list of OffsetDistances corresponds with the position within the list of IntersectingAxes . Therefore OffsetDistances 1 sets the offset to IntersectingAxes 1 , OffsetDistances 2 sets the offset to IntersectingAxes 2 , and OffsetDistances 3 sets the offset to the virtual intersection in direction of the orientation of the cross product of IntersectingAxes 1 and the orthogonal complement of the IntersectingAxes 1 which is the positive or negative direction of the z axis of the design grid position . The following figures explain the usage of the OffsetDistances and IntersectingAxes attributes. Figure 1 illustrates two offset distances given where the virtual intersection is defined in the xy plane of the grid axis placement. Figure 1 Virtual grid intersection with two offsets Figure 2 illustrates three offset distances given where the virtual intersection is defined by an offset in direction of the z axis of the design grid placement to the virtual intersection in the xy plane of the grid axis placement. Figure 2 Virtual grid intersection with three offsets The distance of the offset curve OffsetDistances n is measured from the basis curve. The distance may be positive, negative or zero. A positive value of distance defines an offset in the direction which is normal to the curve in the sense of an anti clockwise rotation through 90 degrees from the tangent vector T at the given point. This is in the direction of orthogonal complement T . This can be reverted by the SameSense attribute at [[IfcGridAxis]] which may switch the sense of the AxisCurve . Figure 3 illustrates an example of a negative offset where the figure shows the side of the offset. IntersectingAxes 1 .AxisCurve is an [[IfcTrimmedCurve]] with an [[IfcCircle]] as BasisCurve and SenseAgreement TRUE. IntersectingAxes 1 .SameSense TRUE. OffsetDistances 1 is a negative length measure Figure 3 Virtual grid intersection negative offset HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5. .change ifc2x IFC2x CHANGE Renamed from IfcConstraintRelIntersection. .spec head Informal Propositions 1. Both, IntersectingAxes 1 and IntersectingAxes 2 shall be two [[IfcGridAxis]] defined by the same [[IfcGrid]] . 2.
