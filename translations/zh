The list of normalized vectors u defines the columns of an orthogonal matrix T. These vectors are computed, by the base axis function, from the direction attributes axis1, axis2 and, in Cartesian transformation operator 3d, axis3. If T 1 , the transformation includes mirroring. The local origin point A , the scale value S and the matrix T together define a transformation. The transformation for a point with position vector P is defined by P A S TP The transformation for a direction d is defined by d Td The transformation for a vector with orientation d and magnitude k is defined by d Td, and k Sk For those entities whose attributes include an axis2 placement, the transformation is applied, after the derivation, to the derived attributes p defining the placement coordinate directions. For a transformed surface, the direction of the surface normal at any point is obtained by transforming the normal, at the corresponding point, to the original surface. For geometric entities with attributes such as the radius of a circle which have the dimensionality of length, the values will be multiplied by S . For curves on surface the p curve.reference to curve will be unaffected by any transformation.

NOTE Since the BasisCurve is closed type [[IfcCircle]] , the exception of the informal proposition IP3 applies, i.e. the sense flag is not required to be consistent with the parameter values of Trim1 and Trim1 , so the rule sense parameter 1 parameter 2 may not be fulfilled. .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO CD 10303 42 1992 A trimmed curve is a bounded curve which is created by taking a selected portion, between two identified points, of the associated basis curve. The basis curve itself is unaltered and more than one trimmed curve may reference the same basis curve. Trimming points for the curve may be identified by parametric value geometric position both of the above At least one of these shall be specified at each end of the curve. The SenseAgreement makes it possible to unambiguously define any segment of a closed curve such as a circle. The combinations of sense and ordered end points make it possible to define four distinct directed segments connecting two different points on a circle or other closed curve. For this purpose cyclic properties of the parameter range are assumed for example, 370 degrees is equivalent to 10 degrees. The [[IfcTrimmedCurve]] has a parameterization which is inherited from the particular basis curve reference. More precisely the parameter s of the trimmed curve is derived from the parameter of the basis curve as follows if SenseAgreement is TRUE s t t 1 if SenseAgreement is FALSE s t 2 t In the above equations t 1 is the value given by Trim1 or the parameter value corresponding to point 1 and t 2 is the value given by Trim2 or the parameter value corresponding to point 2. The resultant [[IfcTrimmedCurve]] has a parameter ranging from 0 at the first trimming point to t 2 t 1 at the second trimming point. NOTE In case of a closed curve, it may be necessary to increment t1 or t2 by the parametric length for consistency with the sense flag. NOTE Entity adapted from trimmed curve defined in ISO 10303 42 HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0 .spec head Informal Propositions 1.

msgid "IfcArcIndex_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The [[IfcArcIndex]] describes a single circular arc segment within a poly curve by providing a list on indices. The first index is the start point of the circular arc, the second index is a point on arc, the third index is the end point of the circular arc. The three points shall not be co linear. NOTE The type is used for [[IfcIndexedPolyCurve]] to point into an [[IfcCartesianPointList]] for providing the Cartesian points of the circular arc segments of the poly curve. HISTORY New Type in IFC4 ADD1 .spec head Informal Propositions 1. The second index, resolving to a point on arc, shall resolve into a Cartesian point that has approximately the same distance to the start point and the end point of the circular arc. This is due to avoid numeric instability, if the point on arc is too close to either the start or the end point."
