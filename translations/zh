msgstr "An [[IfcLocalPlacement]] defines the relative placement of a product in relation to the placement of another product or the absolute placement of a product within the geometric representation context of the project. The [[IfcLocalPlacement]] allows that an [[IfcProduct]] can be placed by this [[IfcLocalPlacement]] through the attribute ObjectPlacement within the local coordinate system of the object placement of another [[IfcProduct]] , which is referenced by the PlacementRelTo . Rules to prevent cyclic relative placements have to be introduced on the application level. If the PlacementRelTo is not given, then the [[IfcProduct]] is placed absolutely within the world coordinate system. The following conventions shall apply as default relative positions if the relative placement is used. The conventions are given for all five direct subtypes of [[IfcProduct]] , the [[IfcSpatialStructureElement]] , [[IfcElement]] , [[IfcAnnotation]] , [[IfcGrid]] , [[IfcPort]] . More detailed placement information is given at the level of subtypes of those five types mentioned. For the subtypes of [[IfcSpatialStructureElement]] the following conventions apply [[IfcSite]] shall be placed absolutely within the world coordinate system established by the geometric representation context of the [[IfcProject]] [[IfcFacility]] shall be placed relative to the local placement of [[IfcSite]] [[IfcFacilityPart]] shall be placed relative to the local placement of [[IfcFacility]] For [[IfcGrid]] and [[IfcAnnotation]] the convention applies that it shall be placed relative to the local placement of its container, either [[IfcSite]] , [[IfcBuilding]] , or [[IfcBuildingStorey]] it should be the same container element that is referenced by the [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] containment relationship, For [[IfcAlignment]] placed relative to the local placement of its container [[IfcSite]] when not placed absolutely within the world coordinate system. For [[IfcPort]] the convention applies that it shall be placed relative to the local placement of the [[IfcElement]] it belongs to it should be the same element that is referenced by the [[IfcRelConnectsPortToElement]] connection relationship, For [[IfcElement]] the convention applies that it shall be placed relative to the local placement of its container, either [[IfcSite]] , [[IfcFacility]] , or [[IfcFacilityPart]] it should be the same container element that is referenced by the [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] containment relationship, to the local placement of the [[IfcElement]] to which it is tied by an element composition relationship for features that are located relative to the main component such as openings , as expressed by [[IfcRelVoidsElement]] and [[IfcRelProjectsElement]] for elements that fill an opening such as doors or windows , as expressed by [[IfcRelFillsElement]] for coverings that cover the element, as expressed by [[IfcRelCoversBldgElements]] for sub components that are aggregated to the main component, as expressed by [[IfcRelAggregates]] and [[IfcRelNests]] .

msgid "IfcVirtualGridIntersection_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcVirtualGridIntersection]] defines the derived location of the intersection between two grid axes. Offset values may be given to set an offset distance to the grid axis for the calculation of the virtual grid intersection. The two intersecting axes IntersectingAxes define the intersection point, which exact location in terms of the Cartesian point representing the intersection has to be calculated from the geometric representation of the two participating curves. NOTE The [[IfcGrid]] local placement, that can be provided relative to the local placement of another spatial structure element, has to be taken into account for calculating the absolute placement of the [[IfcVirtualGridIntersection]] . Where rules and informal rules ensure, that the IntersectingAxes belong to the same [[IfcGrid]] Offset values may be given OffsetDistances . If given, the position within the list of OffsetDistances corresponds with the position within the list of IntersectingAxes . Therefore OffsetDistances 1 sets the offset to IntersectingAxes 1 , OffsetDistances 2 sets the offset to IntersectingAxes 2 , and OffsetDistances 3 sets the offset to the virtual intersection in direction of the orientation of the cross product of IntersectingAxes 1 and the orthogonal complement of the IntersectingAxes 1 which is the positive or negative direction of the z axis of the design grid position . The following figures explain the usage of the OffsetDistances and IntersectingAxes attributes. Figure 1 illustrates two offset distances given where the virtual intersection is defined in the xy plane of the grid axis placement. Figure 1 Virtual grid intersection with two offsets Figure 2 illustrates three offset distances given where the virtual intersection is defined by an offset in direction of the z axis of the design grid placement to the virtual intersection in the xy plane of the grid axis placement. Figure 2 Virtual grid intersection with three offsets The distance of the offset curve OffsetDistances n is measured from the basis curve. The distance may be positive, negative or zero. A positive value of distance defines an offset in the direction which is normal to the curve in the sense of an anti clockwise rotation through 90 degrees from the tangent vector T at the given point. This is in the direction of orthogonal complement T . This can be reverted by the SameSense attribute at [[IfcGridAxis]] which may switch the sense of the AxisCurve . Figure 3 illustrates an example of a negative offset where the figure shows the side of the offset. IntersectingAxes 1 .AxisCurve is an [[IfcTrimmedCurve]] with an [[IfcCircle]] as BasisCurve and SenseAgreement TRUE. IntersectingAxes 1 .SameSense TRUE.
