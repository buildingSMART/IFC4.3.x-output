msgid "IfcBeam_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcBeam]] is a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, structural member that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending. It represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing. .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO 6707 1 structural member for carrying load s between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so. NOTE The representation of load bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of [[IfcStructuralMember]] with [[IfcStructuralCurveMember]] being mostly applicable as part of an [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] . NOTE For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity [[IfcMember]] should be used. The camber of a beam may be defined by assigning a StructuralCurveMember with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction. There are two entities for beam occurrences [[IfcBeamStandardCase]] used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] . These beams are always represented geometricly by an Axis and a SweptSolid or AdvancedSweptSolid shape representation or by a Clipping geometry based on the swept solid , if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] assigned. NOTE Model view definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, for example, by excluding tapering from an [[IfcBeamStandardCase]] implementation. [[IfcBeam]] used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only AdvancedBrep , Brep , SurfaceModel , or Tessellation geometry. NOTE Model view definitions and implementer agreements may impose the use of [[IfcBeam]] in all cases by excluding [[IfcBeamStandardCase]] from scope of the model view.

Proxies can also be used as spatial place holders or provisions, that are later replaced by special types of elements. One use of the proxy object is a provision for voids, i.e. where a particular volume of space is requested by an engineering function that might later be accepted or rejected. If accepted it is transformed into a void within a building element, like a wall opening, or a slab opening. The provision for voids is exchanged as an [[IfcBuildingElementProxy]] with the PredefinedType ProvisionForVoid. Such proxy shall have a swept solid geometry, where the profile of the swept solid lies on near the surface of the referred building element and the extrusion depths is equal to or bigger then in case of round or otherwise irregular element shape the thickness of the building element. The appropriate property set should be attached. In addition to the provision for voids, the building element proxy can also represent a provision for space, often the necessary space allocation for mechanical equipment that will be determined in a later design phase. The provision for space is exchanged as an [[IfcBuildingElementProxy]] with the PredefinedType ProvisionForSpace.

msgid "IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum_DEFINITION"
msgstr "This enumeration defines the basic ways to describe how an [[IfcDoor]] or [[IfcDoorType]] operate, as shown in Figure 1. It combines the partitioning of the access barrier into single or multiple REMOVE door panels and the operation types of those panels. In the most common case of swinging doors the [[IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum]] defined the hinge side left hung or right hung and the opening direction opening to the left, opening to the right . Whether the door opens inwards or outwards is determined by the local coordinate system of the [[IfcDoor]] REMOVE , or [[IfcDoorStandardCase]] . NOTE There are different definitions in various countries on what a left opening or left hung or left swing door is same for right . Therefore the IFC definition terms may derive from the local standard and may need to be mapped appropriately. HISTORY New Enumeration in IFC4. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE The new [[IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum]] replaces the use of [[IfcDoorStyleOperationEnum]] that is deprecated from IFC4 onwards. bSI Documentation"
