msgid "IfcClassification_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcClassification]] is used for the arrangement of objects into a class or category according to a common purpose or their possession of common characteristics. A classification in the sense of [[IfcClassification]] is taxonomy, or taxonomic scheme, arranged in a hierarchical structure. A category of objects relates to other categories in a generalization specialization relationship. Therefore the classification items in an classification are organized in a tree structure. The [[IfcClassification]] identifies the classification system or source to which a classification reference refers to. Each classification reference may reference an instance of [[IfcClassification]] . A classification system declared may be either formally published, or it may be a locally defined method of classifiying information. NOTE Examples for such formally published classifications are Omniclass, Uniclass, Masterformat, or DIN277. There are two methods to define and reference a classification system 1. Including the classification system structure within the dataset Here a hierarchical tree of [[IfcClassificationReference]] s is included that defines the classification system including the relationship between the classification items. The ReferencedSource attribute of [[IfcClassificationReference]] links the classification item to the parent item, and the parent item finally to the [[IfcClassification]] . 2. Referencing the classification system by a classification key or id Here the [[IfcClassificationReference]] is used to assign a classification id or key as Identification attribute and it may link by ReferencedSource attribute directly to the [[IfcClassification]] . HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5 .change ifc2x4 IFC 2x4 CHANGE Attribute Edition made optional. Attributes Description , Location , and ReferenceTokens and inverse attribute HasReferences added."

msgid "IfcClassificationReference_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcClassificationReference]] is a reference into a classification system or source see [[IfcClassification]] for a specific classification key or notation . The inherited attributes have the following meaning Identification holds the key provided for a specific references to classification items or tables . Name allows for a human interpretable designation of a classification notation. Location optionally holds a direct URI link into the classification system or source to hyperlink the classification key. The [[IfcClassificationReference]] can either be assigned directly to the [[IfcClassification]] , such as if no classification hierarchy has to be included, or it references the parent classification notation, if the fully classification hierarchy is included in the data set. The first is refered to as lightweight classification , and the second as full classification . The attribute ReferencedSource then holds the following information choice by [[IfcClassificationReferenceSelect]] 1. being of type [[IfcClassification]] direct reference to the classification system with meta information provided 2. being of type [[IfcClassificationReference]] reference to the parent classification notation within the classification hierarchy. EXAMPLE The [[IfcClassificationReference]] can be used as a form of lightweight classification through the Identification attribute inherited from the abstract [[IfcExternalReference]] class. In this case, the Identification could take for instance the Uniclass notation L6814 which, if the classification was well understood by all parties and was known to be taken from a particular classification source, would be sufficient. The Name attribute could be the title Tanking . This would remove the need for the overhead of the more complete classification structure of the model.

A Uniform Resource Locator, URL, is a string conforming to a standardized format, which refers to a resource on the internet such as a document or an image by its location. A Uniform Resource Name, URN, is intended to serve as persistent, location independent resource identifier and is designed to make it easy to map other namespaces that share the properties of URNs into URN space.
