msgid "IfcClosedShell_DEFINITION"
msgstr ".extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO CD 10303 42 1992 A closed shell is a shell of the dimensionality 2 which typically serves as a bound for a region in R3. A closed shell has no boundary, and has non zero finite extent. If the shell has a domain with coordinate space R3, it divides that space into two connected regions, one finite and the other infinite. In this case, the topological normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the infinite region. The shell is represented by a collection of faces. The domain of the shell, if present, contains all those faces, together with their bounds. Associated with each face in the shell is a logical value which indicates whether the face normal agrees with TRUE or is opposed to FALSE the shell normal. The logical value can be applied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if the shell boundary attribute member is a face without the orientation attribute. The combinatorial restrictions on closed shells and geometrical restrictions on their domains are designed to ensure that any domain associated with a closed shell is a closed, orientable manifold. The domain of a closed shell, if present, is a connected, closed, oriented 2 manifold. It is always topologically equivalent to an H fold torus for some H 0. The number H is referred to as the surface genus of the shell. If a shell of genus H has a domain within coordinate space R 3 , then the finite region of space inside it is topologically equivalent to a solid ball with H tunnels drilled through it. The Euler equation applies with B 0, because in this case there are no holes. As in the case of open shells, the surface genus H may not be known a priori, but shall be an integer 0. Thus a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a well formed closed shell is the following Image .. .. .. .. figures ifcopenshell math1.gif NOTE Entity adapted from closed shell defined in ISO 10303 42.

No edge shall be referenced by more than two faces. 4. Distinct faces of the shell do not intersect, but may share edges or vertices. 5. Distinct edges do not intersect but may share vertices. 6. Each face reference shall be unique. 7. The loops of the shell shall not be a mixture of poly loop and other loop types.

The domain of the underlying geometry of the face, if present, does not contain its bounds, and 0 Ξ . A face is represented by its bounding loops, which are defined as face bounds. A face has a topological normal n and the tangent to a loop is t. For a loop bounding a face with defined geometry, the cross product n x t points toward the interior of the face.

With each loop is associated a BOOLEAN flag to signify whether the loop direction is oriented with respect to the face normal TRUE or should be reversed FALSE . A face shall have at least one bound, and the loops shall not intersect. One loop is optionally distinguished as the outer loop of the face. If so, it establishes a preferred way of embedding the face domain in the plane, in which the other bounding loops of the face are inside the outer bound. Because the face domain is arcwise connected, no inner loop will contain any other loop. This is true regardless of which embedding in the plane is chosen.
