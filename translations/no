msgstr "An element component is a representation for minor items included in, added to or connecting to or between elements, which usually are not of interest from the overall building structure viewpoint.

Typical examples of [[IfcElementComponent]] s include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories.

X 0D X 0D HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2 X 0D X 0D It is often desirable to model a number of same shaped element components by means of a single occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements. In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below. X 0D X 0D To express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level, a Qto ElementComponentPatternQuantities should be provided via [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] and contain the number of pieces which are placed by a single [[IfcElementComponent]] instance.

The product definition shape consists of an [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] with the attribute values X 0D X 0D RepresentationIdentifier Row X 0D RepresentationType GeometricCurveSet X 0D X 0D and one or several curves as geometric items. The curves represent where reference points of the pieces are located. For example, such reference points may be at the heads of mechanical fasteners or at the starting point of the extrusion axis of reinforcement bars. In case of straight components bolts, nails, staples, straight reinforcement bars, or similar , the local placement of the [[IfcElementComponent]] shall be located and oriented such that the local z axis is parallel with the axes of the components. A Qto ElementComponentPatternQuantities should denote the count of pieces in the row or array and their spacing.bSI Documentation"
