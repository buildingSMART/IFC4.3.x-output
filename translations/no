msgid "IfcBeam_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcBeam]] is a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, structural member that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending. It represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing. .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO 6707 1 structural member for carrying load s between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so. NOTE The representation of load bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of [[IfcStructuralMember]] with [[IfcStructuralCurveMember]] being mostly applicable as part of an [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] . NOTE For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity [[IfcMember]] should be used. The camber of a beam may be defined by assigning a StructuralCurveMember with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction. There are two entities for beam occurrences [[IfcBeamStandardCase]] used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] . These beams are always represented geometricly by an Axis and a SweptSolid or AdvancedSweptSolid shape representation or by a Clipping geometry based on the swept solid , if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] assigned. NOTE Model view definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, for example, by excluding tapering from an [[IfcBeamStandardCase]] implementation. [[IfcBeam]] used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only AdvancedBrep , Brep , SurfaceModel , or Tessellation geometry. NOTE Model view definitions and implementer agreements may impose the use of [[IfcBeam]] in all cases by excluding [[IfcBeamStandardCase]] from scope of the model view. HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0"

Proxies can also be used as spatial place holders or provisions, that are later replaced by special types of elements. One use of the proxy object is a provision for voids, i.e. where a particular volume of space is requested by an engineering function that might later be accepted or rejected.

The provision for voids is exchanged as an [[IfcBuildingElementProxy]] with the PredefinedType ProvisionForVoid.

It is accessible by the inverse HasAssociations relationship. Multi layer plates can be represented by refering to several [[IfcMaterialLayer]] s within the [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] that is referenced from the [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]]. Material information can also be given at the [[IfcPlateType]], defining the common attribute data for all occurrences of the same type. It is then accessible by the inverse IsDefinedBy relationship pointing to [[IfcPlateType]].HasAssociations and via [[IfcRelAssociatesMaterial]].RelatingMaterial. The [[IfcPlateStandardCase]] defines in addition that the [[IfcPlateType]] should have a unique [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]], that is referenced by the [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] assigned to all occurrences of this [[IfcPlateType]]. Figure 250 illustrates assignment of [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] and [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] to the [[IfcPlateStandardCase]] as the plate occurrence and to the [[IfcPlateType]]. The same [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] shall be shared by many occurrences of [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]].

The [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]].OffsetFromReferenceLine is given as a distance from this plane. The [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]].DirectionSense defines how the [[IfcMaterialLayer]] s are assigned to the reference plane. POSITIVE means in direction to the positive z axis of the reference coordinate system.

PLUMBINGWALL A pier, or enclosure, or encasement, normally used to enclose plumbing in sanitary rooms. Such walls often do not extent to the ceiling. SHEAR A wall designed to withstand shear loads.
