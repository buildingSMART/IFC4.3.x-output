This logical relationship identifies that there is a predecessor or relating process and a successor or related process. In IFC, there may be one predecessor and one successor in the relationship. Many occurrences of [[IfcRelSequence]] may exist to describe the sequence relationships of a predecessor task with many successor tasks or of many predecessor tasks with one successor task, thus enabling a m n sequence relationship between tasks. Please note that sequence relationships can be used to define dependencies between process occurrences but also between process types for further information see [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] and [[IfcTaskType]] . In case of defining dependencies between process occurrences sequence relationships should stay within the limits of a directed, non cyclic graph. X 0D X 0D A sequence type may be set for a sequence. For tasks assigned to a work schedule, it is expected that the sequence type will be asserted. For a process map, where the sequence relationship between processes is simply a logical flow, it need not be asserted. X 0D X 0D A time lag may be assigned to a sequence, and the sequence type defines the way in which the time lag applies to the sequence either as a ratio or percentage of time duration e.g. start successor task when predecessor is 50 complete or as a time measure e.g. start successor task 1 week after commencement of the predecessor task . Care should be used when assigning a time lag to a sequence depending on the setting of the sequence type since there is no checking that the time lag value is in keeping with the sequence type set.bSI Documentation"
