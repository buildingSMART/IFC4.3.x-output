FAX GATEWAY MODEM A modem from modulator demodulator is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information, and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information. NETWORKAPPLIANCE NETWORKBRIDGE A network bridge connects multiple network segments at the data link layer layer 2 of the OSI model, and the term layer 2 switch is very often used interchangeably with bridge. NETWORKHUB A network hub connects multiple network segments at the physical layer layer 1 of the OSI model. PRINTER A machine that has the primary function of printing text and or graphics onto paper or other media. REPEATER A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it at a higher level and or higher power, or onto the other side of an obstruction, so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. ROUTER A router is a networking device whose software and hardware are usually tailored to the tasks of routing and forwarding information. For example, on the Internet, information is directed to various paths by routers. SCANNER A machine that has the primary function of scanning the content of printed matter and converting it to digital format that can be stored in a computer. AUTOMATON A self acting artificial device, the behaviour of which is governed either in a stepwise manner by given decision rules or continuously in time by defined relationships, while the output variables of which are created from its input and state variables.
