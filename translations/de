msgid "IfcDoorLiningProperties_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The door lining is the frame which enables the door leaf to be fixed in position. The door lining is used to hang the door leaf. The parameters of the door lining define the geometrically relevant parameter of the lining. NOTE The [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] shall only be applied by the receiving application to parametrically define the 3D shape of a door, if the attribute [[IfcDoorType]] .ParameterTakesPrecedence is set TRUE. The [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] are included in the list of properties of [[IfcDoorType]] .HasPropertySets. More information about the door lining can be included in the same list of the IfcDoorTyype using another [[IfcPropertySet]] for dynamic extensions. The [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] does not hold its own geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type which is inserted by the [[IfcDoor]] into the spatial context of the project as shown in Figure 1. The parameters of the [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] define a standard door lining, including if given a threshold and a transom. The outer boundary of the lining is determined by the Profile shape representation assigned to the [[IfcDoor]] , which inserts the [[IfcDoorType]] . The lining is applied to the left, right and upper side of the opening reveal. The parameters are LiningDepth, if omited, equal to wall thickness this only takes effect if a value for LiningThickness is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no lining. LiningThickness LiningToPanelOffsetX LiningToPanelOffsetY NOTE The parameters LiningToPanelOffsetX and LiningToPanelOffsetY are added in IFC4. The lining can only cover part of the opening reveal. LiningOffset given if lining edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement. NOTE In addition to the LiningOffset, the local placement of the [[IfcDoor]] can already have an offset to the wall edge and thereby shift the lining along the y axis. The actual position of the lining is calculated from the origin of the local placement along the positive y axis with the distance given by LiningOffset. The lining may include a casing, which covers part of the wall faces around the opening. The casing covers the left, right and upper side of the lining on both sides of the wall. The parameters are CasingDepth CasingThickness The lining may include a threshold, which covers the bottom side of the opening. The parameters are ThresholdDepth if omited, equal to wall thickness this only takes effect if a value for ThresholdThickness is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no threshold. ThresholdThickness ThresholdOffset not shown in figure given, if the threshold edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement. The lining may have a transom which separates the door panel from a window panel. The transom, if given, is defined by TransomOffset a parallel edge to the x axis of the local placement TransomThickness The depth of the transom is identical to the depth of the lining and not given as separate parameter. Figure 1 Door lining properties NOTE LiningDepth describes the length of the lining along the reveal of the door opening. It can be given by an absolute value if the door lining has a specific depth depending on the door style. However often it is equal to the wall thickness. If the same door style is used like the same type of single swing door , but inserted into different walls with different thicknesses, it would be necessary to create a special door style for each wall thickness. Therefore several CAD systems allow to set the value to automatically aligned to wall thickness. This should be exchanged by leaving the optional attribute LiningDepth unassigned. The same agreement applies to ThresholdDepth . HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0. Has been renamed from IfcDoorLining in IFC2x. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE The following attributes have been added LiningToPanelOffsetX , LiningToPanelOffsetY .

msgid "IfcDoorPanelProperties_DEFINITION"
msgstr "A door panel is normally a door leaf that opens to allow people or goods to pass. The parameters of the door panel define the geometrically relevant parameter of the panel, The [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of door panels. The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the door. The [[IfcDoorType]] can define doors consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] has to be included for each door panel. The PanelPosition attribute, in conjunction with the [[IfcDoorStyle]].OperationType attribute, determines to which panel the [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] apply. The [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] are included in the list of properties , given by attribute HasPropertySets of the [[IfcDoorType]] . More information about the door panel can be included in the same list of the [[IfcDoorStyle]] using the [[IfcPropertySet]] for dynamic extensions. The [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] does not hold a geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type which is inserted by the [[IfcDoor]] into the spatial context of the project as shown in Figure 1. The parameters of the [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] define a standard door panel, including if given a proportional width to define non uniform double swing or sliding, or folding doors. The outer boundary of the panel is determined by the Profile shape representation assigned to the [[IfcDoor]] , which inserts the [[IfcDoorType]] . It has to take the lining parameter into account as well. The depth of the panel swinging, double acting, and sliding panels is defined by the PanelDepth parameter. PanelDepth For door operation types that include more than one panel, the width of at least one panel is given by a normalised ratio measure. It determines the width of that panel, which is defined as a ratio of the overall width of the door opening.

A door style defines the overall parameter of the door style and refers to the particular parameter of the lining and one or several panels through the [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] and the [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] . The door entity, [[IfcDoor]] , defines a particular occurrence of a door inserted in the spatial context of a project. The actual parameter of the door and or its shape is defined at the [[IfcDoorStyle]] , to which the [[IfcDoor]] is related by the inverse relationship IsDefinedBy pointing to IfcRelDefinedByType . The [[IfcDoorStyle]] also defines the particular attributes for the lining , [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] , and panels, [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] . The [[IfcDoorStyle]] defines the baseline geometry, or the representation map, for all occurrences of the door style, given by the [[IfcDoor]] , pointing to this style. The representation of the door style may be given by the agreed set of minimal parameters, defined for the door lining and the door panel s , or it may be given by a geometric representation used by the [[IfcRepresentationMap]] . The attribute ParameterTakesPrecedence decides, whether the set of parameters can be used to exactly represent the shape of the door style TRUE , or whether the attached [[IfcRepresentationMap]] holds the exact representation FALSE . The IfcDoorStyleOperationTypeEnum defines the general layout of the door style. Depending on the enumerator, the appropriate instances of [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] and [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] are attached in the list of HasPropertySets . The IfcDoorStyleOperationTypeEnum mainly determines the hinge side left hung, or right hung , the operation swinging, sliding, folding, etc. and the number of panels.
