msgstr "IfcAlignment"

msgid "IfcAlignment_DEFINITION"
msgstr "For the purposes of IFC the English term alignment defines three essentially separate but closely interconnected concepts. 1. defintion of a reference system for linear positioning 2. safeguarding and optimization of the movement of vehicles kinematic perspective 3. geometric construction of roads, railway tracks or other linear infrastructure Reference system for linear positioning An alignment is used to define a reference system to position elements mainly for linear construction works, such as roads, rails, bridges, and others. The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology. NOTE See ISO 19148 Geographic information Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing. Kinematic perspective In the kinematic perspective focus is on the safe and optimized movement of a vehicle under the constraints induced by changes in the direction of the horizontal and the vertical layout. Geometric perspective In the geometric perspective the focus is on the proper placement of horizontal and vertical segments to connect certain points along a proposed path. A huge body of knowledge has been developed over a long period of time, in many aspects predating the availability of modern computers and their software. State of the art in contemporary engineering 1. Contemporary engineering usually establishes first a horizontal layout in a properly projected plane. 2. In a second step the vertical profile i.e. sequence of segments with constant gradients together with smoothing segments showing a variation in gradient is added. 3. In the rail domain in most cases a cant layout is added to the horizontal layout to compensate a part of the unwanted lateral acceleration. 4. In a final step the proposed layout is checked against a defined set of rules, formulas and thresholds to guarantee the conformance against the regulation. The sequence of steps might change from case to case and might be repeated one or more times to achieve the economic objectives and fulfill regulatory safety requirements. Contemporary alignment design almost always implements a 2.5 dimension approach. The resulting and documented geometry might be very precise or just good enough to meet safety thresholds. This depends on factors like priorities of the management, date of the design existing alignments might have been designed more then 50 years ago or software tools used. Working with legacy data in a high precision BIM model requires a good understanding of these factors. Distinction between business modeling and IFC core geometry According to IFC modeling principles alignment entities are organised in two large parts. The two parts work together, but they can also be used independently from each other 1. Business aspects of alignment 2. Representation with the IFC geometry resources Business aspects of alignment Here the focus is a on a schema structure as close to business terminology as possible. It is possible to have a very detailed segment structure with many domain specific properties attached. Examples for domain specific properties are design speed or cant deficiency. Representation with IFC geometry resources Here the focus is on using as much of the established IFC geometry entities as possible. A mapping between Business aspects and IFC geometry is proposed. IFC modelling In IFC a single alignment must have a horizontal alignment defined in the x y plane of the engineering coordinate system A single alignment may have an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along z coordinate space a relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and or at constant or variable offsets a 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data. Alignments may be aggregated into referents [[IfcReferent]] or derivative alignments. Derivative alignments may be used to indicate dependent alignments, such as an alignment for a bridge that is relative to a parent alignment for a road, where the child [[IfcAlignment]] may have its shape representation set to [[IfcOffsetCurveByDistances]] that starts and ends at a span within the extent of the shape representation of the parent [[IfcAlignment]] . Alignments may be assigned to groups using [[IfcRelAssignsToGroup]] , where [[IfcGroup]] or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments. Supported shape representations of [[IfcAlignment]] are [[IfcGradientCurve]] as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment represented by their alignment segments [[IfcCompositeCurve]] as a 2D horizontal alignment represented by its horizontal alignment segments without a vertical alignment [[IfcOffsetCurveByDistances]] as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an IfcAlignmentCurve or another [[IfcOffsetCurveByDistances]] [[IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve]] as a 3D curve defined relative to an [[IfcGradientCurve]] to incorporate the application of cant [[IfcPolyline]] as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation such as coming from a survey [[IfcPolyline]] as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation The RepresentationIdentifier shall always be set to Axis and the RepresentationType shall be set to either Curve2D or Curve3D depending on if the referenced curve is 2 or 3 dimensional NOTE Derivative specifications Model View Definitions may expand the above set to include additional supported curve types."

msgstr "An [[IfcAlignmentCant]] is a lateral inclination profile defined along the horizontal alignment. All points defined in this profile have two coordinate values. The first value is the distance along the horizontal alignment, and the second value is the height relative to the projection of the point along vertical alignment. Cant as a railway specificity Why cant is applied .. .. figures ifcalignmentcant wojtczak 2018.png Figure 1 Cant compensation for lateral acceleration. NOTE figure was first published in Basics of Railway Curve Kinematics Presentation, Wojtczak 2018 The diagram in the figure above shows the principle of compensating part of the lateral acceleration by elevating the outer rail relative to the inner rail of a track. Almost always the following principles for the placement of horizontal segments and cant segments are implemented Straight horizontal line no applied cant Horizontal circular arc constant applied cant Horizontal transition bend variation of applied cant according to a defined formula In specific difficult topographic environments like mountain lines the extension of a cant transition may differ from the horizontal transition. So far this has only been found for clothoids and is either a so called shortened ramp can transition is shorter than the corresponding horizontal curvature transition or a so called scissor ramp overlapping variations of cant on both rails with opposite direction . Application of high performance horizontal transition bends is always combined with a cant transition with identical start and end location. In real world designs, such as slow speed sections in railway stations, exceptions to the above principles can be found. It might even happen that the inner rail is elevated relative to the outer rail. Detailed geometric modelling of the superelevation has a low priority in the existing processes in most rail companies. This will very probably change with the introduction of 3D modelling in rail design. The following list shows some use cases Correct 3D placement of certain assets e.g. sleepers Relevant input for calculation of structural gauge space Correct calculation of horizontal coordinate values for the Viennese Bend high performance transition bend Cant and structural gauge space .. .. figures ifcalignmentcant structural gauge and cant.png Figure 2 Cant and structural gauge space"

msgid "IfcAnnotation_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An annotation is an information element within the geometric and spatial context of a project, that adds a note or meaning to the objects which constitutes the project model. Annotations include additional points, curves, text, dimensioning, hatching and other forms of graphical notes. It also includes virtual or symbolic representations of additional model components, not representing products or spatial structures, such as event elements, survey points, contour lines or similar. NOTE Additional presentation information often 2D such as tag number or hatching, that is directly related to a particular product representation is included within the [[IfcProductDefinitionShape]] having various [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] s of the [[IfcElement]] and its subtypes . Only those presentation information, that cannot be directly related to a single product, have to be wrapped within the [[IfcAnnotation]] . If available, the annotation should be related to the spatial context of the project, by containing the annotation within the appropriate level of the building structure site, facility, facility part or building, storey, or space . This is handled by the [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] relationship. The [[IfcAnnotation]] can provide specific 0D, 1D, and 2D geometric items as representation of the annotation, offering annotation point, curves, and surfaces. In addition to the predefined type values in [[IfcAnnotationTypeEnum]] , the following values can be used for the ObjectType with PredefinedType attribute value USERDEFINED . Annotation point is an annotation provided by a point that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of point annotation, some suggested values are SurveyPoint A single survey point represented by a Cartesian point. A property set may add the conditions method, accuracy, etc. to the survey point . SurveyArea A set of survey points represented by Cartesian point. These coordinates are determined relative to the coordinates of a reference point, which acts as the datum for the survey. Properties attached apply equally to all points. The difference in elevation of the survey points enables terrain to be determined. Annotation curve is an annotation provided by a curve that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of curve annotation, some suggested values are ContourLine A line of constant elevation typically used on geographic maps where the spacing of lines at constant intervals of elevation may be used as an indication of slope. IsoBar A line of constant pressure typically used on weather maps or to show pressure gradient in spaces, chambers or externally. IsoLux A line of constant illumination typically used to show the distribution of illumination levels and or day lighting in a space or externally. IsoTherm A line of constant temperature typically used to show the distribution and effect of heating or cooling within a space or to show temperature distribution on a geographic map. Annotation surface is an annotation provided by a surface that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of surface annotation, some suggested values are SurveyArea A surface patch based on survey points.

EXAMPLE Examples of elements in a building construction context are walls, floors, windows and recesses. The elements can be logically contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a certain level within a project structure hierarchy site, building, storey or space . This is done by using the [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the [[IfcRelAssociatesMaterial]] and [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] relationship. In addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type and thereby be defined by the element type properties using the [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] relationship. An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the AEC product.

msgid "IfcElementQuantity_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcElementQuantity]] defines a set of derived measures of an element s physical property. Elements could be spatial structure elements like buildings, storeys, or spaces or building elements like walls, slabs, finishes . The [[IfcElementQuantity]] gets assigned to the element by using the [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] relationship. The optional MethodOfMeasurement attribute defines the code, e.g. from a standard method of measurement, which had been used to calculate the element quantity. NOTE The recognizable values for the name and the method of measurement attributes have to be agreed upon in further agreement documents, such as implementers agreements. Some of these agreements might be limited to a certain region, to which the method of measurement applies. The name attribute, given at the individual Quantities provides a recognizable semantic meaning of the element quantity. Both information is needed to establish a precise meaning for the measure value. An optional description may be assigned to each of the Quantities . All quantities assigned by a single instance of [[IfcElementQuantity]] are deemed to have been generated according to the same method of measurement. However several instances of [[IfcElementQuantity]] are assignable to an element, thus allowing for an element having quantities generated according to several methods of measurement. EXAMPLE To exchange the net floor area of spaces in the German region as [[IfcSpace]] , the name might be Netto Grundfläche net floor area , and the method of measurement might be accordingly DIN277 2 German industry norm no. 277 edition 2 . EXAMPLE The same instance of [[IfcSpace]] may have a different area measure assigned in the German region according to a housing regulation, the name would be Wohnfläche and the method of measurement would be 2.BV . It would be attached to the [[IfcSpace]] by a separate [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] relationship. The [[IfcElementQuantity]] can have the following subtypes of [[IfcPhysicalQuantity]] within its SET of Quantities , which count for the basis measure types used count measure weight measure length measure area measure volume measure time measure Base quantities are quantity definitions that are independent of a particular method of measurement and therefore internationally applicable. Base quantities are defined as gross and net values and provided by measurement of the correct geometric shape representation of the element. This specification includes a set of base quantity definition. See each subtype of [[IfcElement]] for applicable base quantities. The following general agreements apply for each base quantity set [[IfcElementQuantity]].Name [[IfcElementQuantity]].MethodOfMeasurement BaseQuantities [[IfcElementQuantity]].Quantities SET of subtypes of [[IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity]] with values for the Name attribute as published as part of this specifciation.

The position of the grid ObjectPlacement is defined by a 3D coordinate system and thereby the design grid can be used in plan, section or in any position relative to the world coordinate system . The position can be relative to the object placement of other products or grids. The XY plane of the 3D coordinate system is used to place the grid axes, which are 2D curves for example, line, circle, arc, polyline . The inherited attributes Name and Description can be used to define a descriptive name of the grid and to indicate the grid s purpose. A grid is defined by normally two, or in case of a triangular grid three lists of grid axes. The following figures shows some examples. A grid may support a rectangular layout as shown in Figure 1, a radial layout as shown in Figure 2, or a triangular layout as shown in Figure 3. NOTE The PredefinedType denotes the type of grid that is represented by [[IfcGrid]] . The instantiation of [[IfcGridAxis]] s has to agree to the PredefinedType , if provided.

Typical elements are walls and slabs. An [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] , for layered elements with an indication of the layering direction and individual layer thicknesses An [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] , i.e. a material layer set with positioning information along the reference axis or surface of the element.

Elements within the spatial project structure are site as [[IfcSite]] facility as [[IfcFacility]] , or specifically building as [[IfcBuilding]] bridge as [[IfcBridge]] marine facility as [[IfcMarineFacility]] railway as [[IfcRailway]] road as [[IfcRoad]] facility part as [[IfcFacilityPart]] , or specifically storey as [[IfcBuildingStorey]] facility part as [[IfcFacilityPart]] space as [[IfcSpace]] or aggregations or parts thereof. The composition type declares an element to be either an element itself, or an aggregation complex or a decomposition part . The interpretation of these types is given at each subtype of [[IfcSpatialStructureElement]] . The [[IfcRelAggregates]] is defined as an 1 to many relationship and used to establish the relationship between exactly two levels within the spatial project structure. Finally the highest level of the spatial structure is assigned to [[IfcProject]] using the [[IfcRelAggregates]] . The subtypes of [[IfcSpatialStructureElement]] relate to other elements and systems by establishing the following relationships Containment of elements [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] by inverse attribute ContainsElements , used to assign any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. to the spatial structure element in which they are primarily contained. Reference of elements [[IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure]] by inverse attribute ReferencesElements , used to reference any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. in spatial structure elements, other then the one, where it is contained. Reference of systems [[IfcRelServicesBuildings]] by inverse attribute ServicedBySystems , used to reference a sytem, like a building service or electrical distribution system, a zonal system, or a structural analysis system, that is assigned to this spatial structure element. The subtypes of [[IfcSpatialStructureElement]] relate to each other by using the [[IfcRelAggregates]] relationship to build the project spatial structure. Figure 1 shows the use of [[IfcRelAggregates]] to establish a spatial structure including site, building, building section and storey. More information is provided at the level of the subtypes. fig1 .. .. .. .. figures ifcspatialstructureelement spatialstructure.png Figure 1 Spatial structure element composition HISTORY New entity in IFC2x. .spec head Informal Propositions 1.
