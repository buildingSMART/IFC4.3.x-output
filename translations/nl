The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional EC A series and VVG Low loss ballasts EC B series . Low loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load.

msgstr "List of the possible vector groups for the transformer from which that required may be set. Values in the enumeration list follow a standard international code where the first letter describes how the primary windings are connected, X 0D the second letter describes how the secondary windings are connected, and the numbers describe the rotation of voltages and currents from the primary to the secondary side in multiples of 30 degrees. X 0D X 0D D means that the windings are delta connected. X 0D Y means that the windings are star connected. X 0D Z means that the windings are zig zag connected a special start connected providing low reactance of the transformer X 0D The connectivity is only relevant for three phase transformers."
