msgstr "[[IfcGroup]] is an generalization of any arbitrary group. A group is a logical collection of objects. It does not have its own position, nor can it hold its own shape representation. Therefore a group is an aggregation under some non geometrical topological grouping aspects. EXAMPLE An example for a group is a system, since it groups elements under the aspect of their role, regardless of their position in a building. One of the most important usage of a group representing a system is the [[IfcDistributionSystem]] , that groups distribution components, such as space heaters and valves into a heating system. A group can hold any collection of objects, the relationship [[IfcRelAssignsToGroup]] is used to establish the group collection. Objects within a group are products, processes, controls, resources, actors or other groups, thus groups can be nested. An object can be part of zero, one, or many groups. Grouping relationships are not required to be hierarchical nor do they imply a dependency. Groups are assigned to other objects such as a process or a resource by the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object Process assigned using [[IfcRelAssignsToProcess]] Resource assigned using [[IfcRelAssignsToResource]] Controls affecting the group using [[IfcRelAssignsToControl]] A group can be exchanged without having already objects within the group collection. [[IfcGroup]] does not define an own object coordinate system, nor does it have an independent shape representation. NOTE Use [[IfcRelAggregates]] together with the appropriate subtypes of [[IfcProduct]] to define an aggregation of products that may have its own position and shape representation.

msgid "IfcObject"
msgstr "IfcObject"

msgid "IfcObject_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcObject]] is the generalization of any semantically treated thing or process. Objects are things as they appear i.e. occurrences. NOTE Examples of [[IfcObject]] include physically tangible items such as wall, beam or covering, physically existing items such as spaces, or conceptual items such as grids or virtual boundaries. It also stands for processes such as work tasks, for controls such as cost items, or for actors such as persons involved in the design process. Objects can be named, using the inherited Name attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrance. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited Description attribute. The ObjectType attribute is used to store the user defined value for all subtypes of [[IfcObject]] , where a PredefinedType attribute is given, and its value is set to USERDEFINED. to provide a type information could be seen as a very lightweight classifier of the subtype of [[IfcObject]] , if no PredefinedType attribute is given. This is often the case, if no comprehensive list of predefined types is available. Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are several relationships in which objects can be involved Association to external internal resource information an association relationship that refers to external internal sources of information. See supertype [[IfcObjectDefinition]] for more information. Assignment of other objects an assignment relationship that refers to other types of objects. See supertype [[IfcObjectDefinition]] for more information. Aggregation of other objects an aggregation relationship that establishes a whole part relation. Objects can either be a whole, or a part, or both. See supertype [[IfcObjectDefinition]] for more information. Assignment of a type IsTypedBy a definition relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] that uses a type definition to define the common characteristics of this occurrences, potentially including the common shape representation and common properties of all object occurrences assigned to this type. It is a specific occurrence relationship with implied dependencies as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them . Assignment of a partial type IsDeclaredBy , Declares a definition relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] that uses a component of a type definition a part of a type, called the declaring part to define a component of an occurence part of occurrence, called the reflected part . This is also refered to as a deep copy . The common characteristics of all parts in the occurrence are defined by parts in the type. It is a specific occurrence relationship with implied dependencies as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them . Assignment of property sets IsDefinedBy a definition relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] that assignes property set definitions to the object occurrence. NOTE See [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] for an explanatory figure. Also see there for how to override type properties by occurrence properties. See [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] for an explanatory figure for the assignment of a partial type.

Object defintions can be named, using the inherited Name attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrance. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited Description attribute. A context is a specific kind of object definition as it provides the project or library context in which object types and object occurrences are defined. Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are four essential kinds of relationships in which object definitons by their instantiable subtypes can be involved Assignment of other objects an assignment relationship [[IfcRelAssigns]] that refers to other types of objects and creates a bi directional association. The semantic of the assignment is established at the level of the subtypes of the general [[IfcRelAssigns]] relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment. Association to external resources an association relationship [[IfcRelAssociates]] that refers to external sources of information most notably a classification or document and creates a uni directional association. There is no dependency implied by the association.

msgstr "The [[IfcProduct]] is an abstract representation of any object that relates to a geometric or spatial context. An [[IfcProduct]] occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an [[IfcProductDefinitionShape]] being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation with or without underlying geometry of the topological items . Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects referred to as elements for incorporation into an AEC FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations. In addition to physical products covered by the subtype [[IfcElement]] and spatial items covered by the subtype [[IfcSpatialElement]] the [[IfcProduct]] also includes non physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc. Any instance of [[IfcProduct]] defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar or identical occurrences of [[IfcProduct]] , is handled by the [[IfcTypeProduct]] and its subtypes , assigned to one or many occurrences of [[IfcProduct]] by using the objectified relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] .

msgstr "[[IfcResource]] contains the information needed to represent the costs, schedule, and other impacts from the use of a thing in a process. It is not intended to use [[IfcResource]] to model the general properties of the things themselves, while an optional linkage from [[IfcResource]] to the things to be used can be specified specifically, the relationship from subtypes of [[IfcResource]] to [[IfcProduct]] through the [[IfcRelAssignsToResource]] relationship . There are two basic intended uses of [[IfcResource]] . First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of [[IfcResource]] , or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn t have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of [[IfcResource]] or its subtypes alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project. EXAMPLE construction equipment such as earth moving vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of [[IfcResource]] alone. Second, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of [[IfcResource]] objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the [[IfcResource]] instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced. Things that might be used as resources and that are already modeled in the IFC include physical products, people and organizations, and materials. The relationship object [[IfcRelAssignsToResource]] is provided for this approach. The inherited attribute ObjectType is used as a textual code that identifies the resource type.
