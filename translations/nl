Valid operations are regularized union, regularized intersection, and regularized difference. For purpose of Boolean operations, a solid is considered to be a regularized set of points. The final Boolean result depends upon the operation and the two operands. In the case of the difference operator the order of the operands is also significant. The operator can be either union, intersection or difference. The effect of these operators is described below Union on two solids is the new solid that is the regularization of the set of all points that are in either the first operand or the second operand or in both. Intersection on two solids is the new solid that is the regularization of the set of all points that are in both the first operand and the second operand.

The allowed operations are intersection, union, and difference. As a special case a CSG solid can also consists of a single CSG primitive. A CSG solid requires two kinds of information for its complete definition geometric and structural. The geometric information is conveyed by solid models. These typically primitive volumes such as cylinders, wedges and extrusions, but can include general B Rep models. Solid models can also be half space solids. The structural information is in a tree strictly an acyclic directed graph of Boolean result and CSG solids, which represent a recipe for building the solid. The terminal nodes are the geometric primitives and other solids. Every CSG solid has precisely one Boolean result associated with it which is the root of the tree that defines the solid. There may be further Boolean results within the tree as operands . The significance of a CSG solid entity is that the solid defined by the associated tree is thus identified as a significant object itself, and in this way it is distinguished from other Boolean result entities representing intermediate results during the construction process.

msgid "IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid]] is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping an area along a Directrix . The swept area is provided by a subtype of [[IfcProfileDef]] . The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees to the start tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile s x axis agrees to the orthogonal projection of the FixedReference direction within the plane of start tangent and Fixed Reference . The orientation of the curve during the sweeping operation is controlled by the FixedReference direction. The SweptArea is swept along the Directrix in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system used to define the SweptArea is on the Directrix and the local x axis is in the direction of the projection of FixedReference onto the normal plane to the directrix at this point. The resulting solid has the property that the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the Directrix at any point is a copy of the SweptArea . The resulting swept solid is placed by the Position coordinate system. The Directrix and the ReferenceSurface are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the StartParam , being either the parameter value based on the curve parameterization, or by a length measured along the directrix from its beginning. If no StartParam is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the EndParam , being either the parameter value based on the curve parameterization, or by a length measured along the directrix from its beginning. If no EndParam is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix. NOTE The StartParam and the EndParam , if provided as a parameter value, are not normalized by default, they depend upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the [[IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment]] within an [[IfcCompositeCurve]] as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve. NOTE In the case of a curve composed of [[IfcCurveSegment]] , the [[IfcSweptAreaSolid]] Position is dependent on the [[IfcCurveSegment]] StartPlacement and the type of BasisCurve which defines the name function between the start and end explicitly defined as the start point of the next segment points of the segment EXAMPLE The reference surface is any surface plane, cylindric, composite situated in 3D space and positioned in the object coordinate system. In many cases, it is a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, often defined as a p curve at this reference surface. At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system lies at the directrix. The Axis3 the z axis, or normal of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 the x axis, or u of the position coordinate system is identical to the FixedReference direction. The Axis2 the y axis, or v is constructed. In this case the resulting swept solid is not repositioned. The orientation of the SweptArea as it sweeps along the Directrix is precisely defined by a CartesianTransformationOperator3d with attributes LocalOrigin as point 0 0 0 , Axis1 as the orthogonal projection of the FixedReference onto the normal plane defined by Axis3 . Axis3 as the direction of the tangent vector t at the point of the Directrix with parameter u . The remaining attributes are defaulted to define a corresponding transformation matrix T u , which varies with the Directrix parameter u . NOTE The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the Directrix .

At any point along the directrix, the swept profile origin lies on the directrix, the profile s normal points towards the tangent of the directrix, and the profile s x axis is identical to the surface normal at this point. NOTE The profile area s normal has to be identical to the tangent of the directrix at any given point. In case of a directrix having a linear segment at the start point, the segment has to be perpendicular to the profile at start. The Directrix and the ReferenceSurface are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the StartParam , the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no StartParam is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the EndParam , the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no EndParam is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix. The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the Directrix . NOTE The StartParam and the EndParam are not normalized by default, they depend upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the [[IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment]] within an [[IfcCompositeCurve]] as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve. In case of a closed curve, such as [[IfcCircle]] or [[IfcEllipse]] , as the directrix, StartParam and the EndParam shall not exceed the parametic range, they shall not be 360 . EXAMPLE The reference surface is any surface plane, cylindric, composite situated in 3D space and positioned in the object coordinate system. In most cases, it is a plane or a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, in case of a plane it might be defined as a polyline or composite curve, in case of a cylindrical or other non planer reference surface it might often be defined as a p curve on this reference surface. At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system of the implicit plane lies at the directrix. The Axis3 the z axis, or normal of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 the x axis, or u of the position coordinate system is identical to the normal of the reference surface at this point. The Axis2 the y axis, or v is constructed. The resulting body of the swept solid is not repositioned if the inherited Position attribute is omitted. Otherwise the coordinate system established by the Position attribute is used to reposition the body relative to the object coordinate system. EXAMPLE Figure 1 illustrates an example using a cylindrical reference surface and a p curve for sweeping a rectangle. The Postion is not provided and therefore it does not reposition the resulting swept solid. Figure 2 shows the expected result.NOTE The start of the directrix lies at the origin of the object coordinate system, as shown in the illustration,only by coincidence. The start of the directrix and thereby the start of the sweeping operation might be at any point within the object coordinate system and only depends on the position of the directrix.Figure 1 Surface curve wept area solid parameter Figure 2 Surface curve wept area solid results .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO CD 10303 42 1992 A surface curve swept area solid is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping a face along a Directrix lying on a ReferenceSurface . The orientation of the SweptArea is related to the direction of the surface normal. The SweptArea is required to be a curve bounded surface lying in the plane z 0 and this is swept along the Directrix in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system used to define the SweptArea is on the Directrix and the local x axis is in the direction of the normal to the ReferenceSurface at the current point. The resulting solid has the property that the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the Directrix at any point is a copy of the SweptArea . The orientation of the SweptArea as it sweeps along the Directrix is precisely defined by a Cartesian Transformation Operator 3D with attributes Local origin as point 0., 0., 0 , Axis 1 as the normal N to the reference surface at the point of the directrix with parameter u. Axis 3 as the direction of the tangent vector t at the point of the directrix with parameter u. The remaining attributes are defaulted to define a corresponding transformation matrix T u , which varies with the directrix parameter u.
