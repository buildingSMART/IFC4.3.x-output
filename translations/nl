msgstr "Two grid axes which intersects at exactly one intersection see also informal proposition at [[IfcGrid]] . If attribute OffsetDistances is omitted, the intersection defines the placement or ref direction of a grid placement directly. If OffsetDistances are given, the intersection is defined by the offset curves to the grid axes."
