msgid "IfcAppliedValue_DEFINITION"
msgstr "This entity captures a value driven by a formula, with additional qualifications including unit basis, valid date range, and categorization. The extent of the [[IfcAppliedValue]] is determined by the AppliedValue attribute which may be defined either as an [[IfcMeasureWithUnit]] or as an [[IfcMonetaryMeasure]] or as an [[IfcRatioMeasure]] via the [[IfcAppliedValueSelect]] type. Optionally, an [[IfcAppliedValue]] may have an applicable date. This is intended to fix the date on which the value became relevant for use. It may be the date on which the value was set in the model or it may be a prior or future date when the value becomes operable. Similarly, an [[IfcAppliedValue]] may have a fixed until date. This is intended to fix the date on which the value ceases to be relevant for use. An instance of [[IfcAppliedValue]] may have a unit basis asserted. This is defined as an [[IfcMeasureWithUnit]] that determines the extent of the unit value for application purposes. It is assumed that when this attribute is asserted, then the value given to [[IfcAppliedValue]] is that for unit quantity. This is not enforced within the schema and thus needs to be controlled within an application. Applied values may be referenced from a document such as a price list . The relationship between one or more occurrences of [[IfcAppliedValue]] or its subtypes is achieved through the use of the [[IfcExternalReferenceRelationship]] in which the document provides the [[IfcExternalReferenceRelationship]].RelatingExtReference and the value occurrences are the [[IfcExternalReferenceRelationship]].RelatedResourceObjects . HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Entity made non abstract to support general formula expressions of constraints, data type of date based attributes changed into [[IfcDate]] , ValueType and Condition promoted from [[IfcCostValue]] , Components and ArithmeticOperator attributes added to replace IfcAppliedValueRelationship for more efficient encoding and reference tracking. bSI Documentation"

It takes account of fact that currency exchange rates may vary by requiring the recording the date and time of the currency exchange rate used and the source that publishes the rate. There may be many sources and there are different strategies for currency conversion spot rate, forward buying of currency at a fixed rate .

Selecting [[IfcMonetaryMeasure]] allows the specification only of the value, the currency being as set by the global context. Selecting [[IfcRatioMeasure]] assumes that the amount is a percentage or other REAL number. Note that if the amount is normally specified as 20 , then this figure will need to be converted to a multiplier of 0.8 HISTORY New select type in IFC2x2."
