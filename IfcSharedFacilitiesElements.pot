msgstr "An asset is a uniquely identifiable grouping of elements acting as a single entity that has a financial value or that can be operated on as a single unit. An asset is generally the level of granularity at which maintenance operations are undertaken. An asset is a group that can contain one or more elements. Whilst the financial value of a component or element can be defined, financial value is also defined for accounting purposes at the level of the asset. There are a number of actors that can be associated with an asset, each actor having a role. Actors within the scope of the project are indicated using the [[IfcRelAssignsToActor]] .. .. ifckernel lexical ifcrelassignstoactor.htm relationship in which case roles should be defined through the [[IfcActorRole]] .. .. ifcactorresource lexical ifcactorrole.htm class otherwise principal actors are identified as attributes of the class. In the existence of both, direct attributes take precedence. There are a number of costs that can be associated with an asset, each cost having a role. These are specified through the OriginalValue , CurrentValue , TotalReplacementCost and DepreciatedValue attributes.
