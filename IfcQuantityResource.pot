msgid "IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The complex physical quantity, [[IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity]] , is an entity that holds a set of single quantity measure value as defined at the subtypes of [[IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity]] , that all apply to a given component or aspect of the element. X 0D X 0D EXAMPLE A layered element, like a wall, may have several material layers, each having individual quantities, like footprint area, side area and volume. An instance of [[IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity]] would group these individual quantities given by a subtype of [[IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity]] and name them according to the material layer name by using the Name attribute. The Discrimination attribute would then be layer . X 0D X 0D A section Quantity Use Definition at individual entities as subtypes of IfcBuildingElement gives guidance to the usage of the Name and Discrimination attribute to characterize the complex quantities.
