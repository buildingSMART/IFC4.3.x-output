msgid "IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The complex physical quantity, [[IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity]] , is an entity that holds a set of single quantity measure value as defined at the subtypes of [[IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity]] , that all apply to a given component or aspect of the element. EXAMPLE A layered element, like a wall, may have several material layers, each having individual quantities, like footprint area, side area and volume. An instance of [[IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity]] would group these individual quantities given by a subtype of [[IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity]] and name them according to the material layer name by using the Name attribute. The Discrimination attribute would then be layer . A section Quantity Use Definition at individual entities as subtypes of IfcBuildingElement gives guidance to the usage of the Name and Discrimination attribute to characterize the complex quantities. HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2 Addendum 1. .change ifc2x2 IFC2x2 ADDENDUM 1 CHANGE The entity [[IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity]] has been added. Upward compatibility for file based exchange is guaranteed."
