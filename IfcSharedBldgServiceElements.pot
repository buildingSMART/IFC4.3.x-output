msgid "IfcDistributionControlElement_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The distribution element [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] defines occurrence elements of a building automation control system that are used to impart control over elements of a distribution system. [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] defines elements of a building automation control system. These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows Impart control over flow control elements [[IfcFlowController]] in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation [[IfcActuator]] . Sensing elements [[IfcSensor]] that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow. Controllers [[IfcController]] typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control. Since [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] , the objectified relationship [[IfcRelFlowControlElements]] has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required. The key distinction between [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] and [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between [[IfcFlowMeter]] subtype of [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] measuring a flow quantity and [[IfcFlowInstrument]] subtype of [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] measuring a flow quality , is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures having inlet outlet pipes for the measured substance follows the [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] hierarchy and therefore [[IfcFlowMeter]] which measures the flow internally . Otherwise, if it monitors controls but does not connect inline within the flow system it is external or is a component of another device , then it follows the [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] hierarchy and therefore [[IfcFlowInstrument]] which may display various attributes through connected sensors . HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Attribute ControlElementId attribute deleted replaced by classification usage. Ports are now primarily defined using [[IfcRelNests]] to enable definition of ports at type definitions both forward and backward compatible , provide a logical order, and reduce the number of relationship objects needed.

Concepts Axis Geometry This represents the 3D flow path of the item having [[IfcShapeRepresentation]].RepresentationType of Curve3D and containing a single [[IfcBoundedCurve]] subtype such as [[IfcPolyline]], [[IfcTrimmedCurve]], or [[IfcCompositeCurve]]. For elements containing directional ports [[IfcDistributionPort]] with FlowDirection of SOURCE or SINK , the direction of the curve indicates direction of flow where a SINK port is positioned at the start of the curve and a SOURCE port is positioned at the end of the curve. This representation is most applicable to flow segment types pipes, ducts, cables , however may be used at other elements to define a primary flow path if applicable. If an element type is defined parametrically such as a flow segment type defining common material profile but no particular length or path , then no representations shall be asserted at the type. NOTE The product representations are defined as representation maps at the level of the supertype [[IfcTypeProduct]], which get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the [[IfcShapeRepresentation]].Item 1 being an [[IfcMappedItem]]. Clearance Geometry This represents the 3D clearance volume of the item having RepresentationType of Surface3D .

msgstr "A distribution port is an inlet or outlet of a product through which a particular substance may flow. Distribution ports are used for passage of solid, liquid, or gas substances, as well as electricity for power or communications. Flow segments pipes, ducts, cables may be used to connect ports across products. Distribution ports are defined by system type and flow direction such that for two ports to be connected, they must share the same system type and have opposite flow directions one side being a SOURCE and the other being a SINK . Ports are similar to openings in that they do not have any visible geometry such geometry is captured at the shape representation of the enclosing element or element type. Ports may have placement that indicates the position and orientation of the connection. Ports are assigned the distribution systems in order to indicate its role in a particular system, e.g. cold water inlet.
