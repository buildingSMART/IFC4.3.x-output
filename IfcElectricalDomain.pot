The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional EC A series and VVG Low loss ballasts EC B series . Low loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load.
