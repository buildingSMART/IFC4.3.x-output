msgid "IfcComplexProperty_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcComplexProperty]] is used to define complex properties to be handled completely within a property set. The included set of properties may be a mixed or consistent collection of [[IfcProperty]] subtypes. This enables the definition of a set of properties to be included as a single property entry in an [[IfcPropertySet]] . The definition of such an [[IfcComplexProperty]] can be reused in many different [[IfcPropertySet]] s. NOTE Since an [[IfcComplexProperty]] may contain other complex properties, sets of properties can be nested. This nesting may be restricted by view definitions and implementer agreements.
