msgid "IfcAnnotationFillArea_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The [[IfcAnnotationFillArea]] defines an area by a definite OuterBoundary , that might include InnerBoundaries . The areas defined by the InnerBoundaries are excluded from applying the fill area style. The InnerBoundaries shall not intersect with the OuterBoundary nor being outside of the OuterBoundary . The fill area style that is applied to the [[IfcAnnotationFillArea]] is declared using the [[IfcFillAreaStyle]] , associated to the area by an [[IfcStyledItem]] . Applicable fill area styles are a solid color, a hatching, tiles, or a combination of those styles. .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO 10303 46 An annotation fill area is a set of curves that may be filled with hatching, colour or tiling. The annotation fill are is described by boundaries which consist of non intersecting, non self intersecting closed curves. These curves form the boundary of planar areas to be filled according to the style for the annotation fill area. Figure 1 illustrates annotation fill area. Figure 1 Annotation fill area NOTE Entity adapted from annotation fill area defined in ISO10303 46 HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2. .change ifc2x3 IFC2x3 CHANGE The two attributes OuterBoundary and InnerBoundaries are added and replace the previous single boundary. .spec head Informal Propositions 1. Any curve that describes an inner boundary shall not intersect with, nor include, another curve defining an inner boundary. 2. The curve defining the outer boundary shall not intersect with any curve defining an inner boundary, nor shall it be surrounded by a curve defining an inner boundary."
