msgid "IfcBeam"
msgstr "Beam"

msgid "IfcBeam_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcBeam]] is typically a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, structural member that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending. It may also represent such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing.There are two main representations for beam occurrences: [[IfcBeam]] with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might change uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. These beams are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.; [[IfcBeam]] without IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non-uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only 'AdvancedBrep', 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, if a more parametric representation is not intended.For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity [[IfcMember]] should be used.REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: structural member for carrying load(s) between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so.;"

A door can: be a "free standing" door, contained in an [[IfcSpatialElement]] such as an [[IfcBuildingStorey]].; fill an opening, typically in a wall. The door will then have a FillsVoids attribute which uses the [[IfcRelFillsElement]] relationship to relate the [[IfcDoor]] with the [[IfcOpeningElement]];; be part of an element assembly, typically an [[IfcCurtainWall]]. The door will then have a Decomposes attribute which uses the the [[IfcRelAggregates]] relationship to relate the door with the assembly of elements;There are two main representations for door occurrences: [[IfcDoor]] entities that have a 3D rectangle 'Profile' shape representation defined. This profile can then be used to parametrically generate the geometry of a door. If not provided, the profile of the [[IfcOpeningElement]] can be used if the door fills an opening. The parameters are specified on the relating [[IfcDoorType]] that references IfcDoorLiningProperties and IfcDoorPanelProperties for each panel in the door;; [[IfcDoor]] entities that are not parametrically generated and have only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry.In addition, an [[IfcDoor]] may commonly include a 'FootPrint' representation defining the 2D shape of the door and its swing.The parameters of a door are defined by both the [[IfcDoor]] occurrence and its [[IfcDoorType]]. The [[IfcDoor]] specifies: the door width and height; the door opening direction (by the positive y-axis of the ObjectPlacement)The [[IfcDoorType]] specifies parameters which are common to all of its occurrences of [[IfcDoor]]: the operation type (single swing, double swing, revolving, etc.); the door hinge side (by using two different styles for right and left opening doors); the particular attributes for the lining by the IfcDoorLiningProperties; the particular attributes for the panels by the IfcDoorPanelPropertiesREFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: construction for closing an opening, intended primarily for access with hinged, pivoted or sliding operation.;"

The location of the plate (being horizontal, vertical or sloped) is not relevant to its definition.Plates are normally made of steel, other metallic material, or by glass panels. However the definition of [[IfcPlate]] is material independent and specific material information shall be handled by using IfcRelAssociatesMaterial to assign a material specification to the [[IfcPlate]].Plates are often add-on parts. This is represented by the [[IfcRelAggregates]] decomposition mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as [[IfcPlate]], into a container element such as [[IfcElementAssembly]] or [[IfcCurtainWall]].An instance of [[IfcPlate]] should preferably get its geometric representation and material assignment through the type definition by [[IfcPlateType]] assigned using the [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] relationship. This allows identical plates in a construction to be represented by the same instance of [[IfcPlateType]].A plate may have openings, such as voids or recesses. They are defined by an [[IfcOpeningElement]] attached to the plate using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to [[IfcRelVoidsElement]]. The position number of a plate as often used in steel construction is assigned through the attribute [[IfcElement]].TagThere are two main representations for plate occurrences: [[IfcPlate]] with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all occurrences of plates, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage. These plates are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.; [[IfcPlate]] without IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of plates, particularly for plates with changing thickness, or plates with non planar surfaces, and plates having only 'SurfaceModel' or 'Brep' geometry or if a more parametric representation is not intended.REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: thin, rigid, flat, metal product, of a thickness greater than that of a sheet.;"
