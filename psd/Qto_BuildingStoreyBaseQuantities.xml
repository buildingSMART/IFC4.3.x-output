  <Definition>Base quantities that are common to the definition of all occurrences of building storey.


## Comments

### GrossFloorArea

Includes the area of construction elements within the building storey. May be provided in addition to the quantities of the spaces and the construction elements assigend to the storey. In case of inconsistencies, the individual quantities of spaces and construction elements take precedence.

### GrossPerimeter

Without taking interior slab openings into account.

### GrossVolume

Sum of all gross volumes of spaces enclosed. It includes the volumes of construction elements within the element. May be provided in addition to the quantities of the spaces and the construction elements assigend to the element. In case of inconsistencies, the individual quantities of spaces and construction elements take precedence.

### NetFloorArea

It excludes the area of construction elements within the building storey. May be provided in addition to the quantities of the spaces assigend to the storey. In case of inconsistencies, the individual quantities of spaces take precedence.

### NetVolume

Sum of all net volumes of spaces enclosed by the building storey. It iexcludes the volumes of construction elements within the building storey. May be provided in addition to the quantities of the spaces assigend to the storey. In case of inconsistencies, the individual quantities of spaces take precedence.</Definition>
