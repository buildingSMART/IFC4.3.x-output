      <Name>Height</Name>
      <Definition>Height of the object. It is the upper hight of the railing above the floor or stair.
The size information is provided in addition to the shape representation and the geometric parameters used within. In cases of inconsistency between the geometric parameters and the size properties, provided in the attached property set, the geometric parameters take precedence.</Definition>

    </QtoDef>
    <QtoDef>
      <Name>FinishCeilingHeight</Name>
      <Definition>Height of the suspended ceiling (from top of flooring to the bottom of the suspended ceiling). To be provided only if the space has a suspended ceiling with constant height.</Definition>

    </QtoDef>
    <QtoDef>
      <Name>FinishFloorHeight</Name>
      <Definition>Height of the flooring (from base slab without flooring to the flooring height). To be provided only if the space has a constant flooring height.</Definition>

    <QtoDef>
      <Name>NetPerimeter</Name>
      <Definition>Net perimeter at the floor level of this space. It excludes those parts of the perimeter that are created by by virtual boundaries and openings (like doors). It is the measurement used for skirting boards and may includes the perimeter of internal fixed objects like columns.</Definition>
