      <Name>Height</Name>
      <Definition>Characteristic height

Total height (from base slab without flooring to ceiling without suspended ceiling) for this space (measured from top of slab below to bottom of slab above). To be provided only if the space has a constant height.</Definition>
      <QtoType>Q_LENGTH</QtoType>
    </QtoDef>
    <QtoDef>
      <Name>FinishCeilingHeight</Name>
      <Definition>Height of the suspended ceiling (from top of flooring to the bottom of the suspended ceiling). To be provided only if the space has a suspended ceiling with constant height.</Definition>

    <QtoDef>
      <Name>GrossPerimeter</Name>
      <Definition>Gross perimeter at the outer contour of the object.

Measured at floor level with all sides of the space, including those parts of the perimeter that are created by virtual boundaries and openings (like doors).</Definition>
      <QtoType>Q_LENGTH</QtoType>
    </QtoDef>
    <QtoDef>
      <Name>NetPerimeter</Name>
      <Definition>Net perimeter at the floor level of this space. It excludes those parts of the perimeter that are created by by virtual boundaries and openings (like doors). It is the measurement used for skirting boards and may includes the perimeter of internal fixed objects like columns.</Definition>

    <QtoDef>
      <Name>GrossFloorArea</Name>
      <Definition>Sum of all gross floor areas within the spatial structure element.

Includes the area covered by elements inside the space (columns, inner walls, etc.) and excludes the area covered by wall claddings.</Definition>

    </QtoDef>
    <QtoDef>
      <Name>NetFloorArea</Name>
      <Definition>Sum of all net usable floor areas.

It excludes the area covered  by elements inside the space (columns, inner walls, built-in's etc.), slab openings, or other protruding elements. Varying heights are not taking into account (i.e. no reduction for areas under a minimum headroom).</Definition>
