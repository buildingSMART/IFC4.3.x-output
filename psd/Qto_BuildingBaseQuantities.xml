## Comments

### GrossFloorArea

Includes the area of construction elements within the building. May be provided in addition to the quantities of the spaces and the construction elements assigend to the building. In case of inconsistencies, the individual quantities of spaces and construction elements take precedence.

### GrossVolume

Sum of all gross volumes of spaces enclosed. It includes the volumes of construction elements within the element. May be provided in addition to the quantities of the spaces and the construction elements assigend to the element. In case of inconsistencies, the individual quantities of spaces and construction elements take precedence.

### Height

Standard gross height of this building, from the top surface of the construction floor, to the top surface of the construction floor or roof above. Only provided is there is a constant height.

### NetFloorArea

It excludes the area of construction elements within the building. May be provided in addition to the quantities of the spaces assigend to the building. In case of inconsistencies, the individual quantities of spaces take precedence.

### NetVolume

Sum of all net volumes of spaces enclosed by the building. It excludes the volumes of construction elements within the building. May be provided in addition to the quantities of the spaces assigend to the building. In case of inconsistencies, the individual quantities of spaces take precedence.</Definition>
