      <Name>ValvePattern</Name>
      <Definition>The configuration of the ports of a valve according to either the linear route taken by a fluid flowing through the valve or by the number of ports where:

SINGLEPORT: Valve that has a single entry port from the system that it serves, the exit port being to the surrounding environment.
ANGLED_2_PORT: Valve in which the direction of flow is changed through 90 degrees.
STRAIGHT_2_PORT: Valve in which the flow is straight through.
STRAIGHT_3_PORT: Valve with three separate ports.
CROSSOVER_4_PORT: Valve with 4 separate ports.</Definition>

      <Name>ValveOperation</Name>
      <Definition>The method of valve operation where:

DROPWEIGHT: A valve that is closed by the action of a weighted lever being released, the weight normally being prevented from dropping by being held by a wire, the closure normally being made by the action of heat on a fusible link in the wire
FLOAT: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a float that rises and falls with water level. The float may be a ball attached to a lever or other mechanism
HYDRAULIC: A valve that is opened and closed by hydraulic actuation
LEVER: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a lever rotating the gate within the valve.
LOCKSHIELD: A valve that requires the use of a special lockshield key for opening and closing, the operating mechanism being protected by a shroud during normal operation.
MOTORIZED: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of an electric motor on an actuator
PNEUMATIC: A valve that is opened and closed by pneumatic actuation
SOLENOID: A valve that is normally held open by a magnetic field in a coil acting on the gate but that is closed immediately if the electrical current generating the magnetic field is removed. 
SPRING: A valve that is normally held in position by the pressure of a spring on a plate but that may be caused to open if the pressure of the fluid is sufficient to overcome the spring pressure. 
THERMOSTATIC: A valve in which the ports are opened or closed to maintain a required predetermined temperature.
WHEEL: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a wheel moving the gate within the valve.</Definition>

      <Name>ValveMechanism</Name>
      <Definition>The mechanism by which the valve function is achieved where:

BALL: Valve that has a ported ball that can be turned relative to the body seat ports.
BUTTERFLY: Valve in which a streamlined disc pivots about a diametric axis.
CONFIGUREDGATE: Screwdown valve in which the closing gate is shaped in a configured manner to have a more precise control of pressure and flow change across the valve.
GLAND: Valve with a tapered seating, in which a rotatable plug is retained by means of a gland and gland packing.
GLOBE: Screwdown valve that has a spherical body.
LUBRICATEDPLUG: Plug valve in which a lubricant is injected under pressure between the plug face and the body.
NEEDLE: Valve for regulating the flow in or from a pipe, in which a slender cone moves along the axis of flow to close against a fixed conical seat.
PARALLELSLIDE: Screwdown valve that has a machined plate that slides in formed grooves to form a seal.
PLUG: Valve that has a ported plug that can be turned relative to the body seat ports.
WEDGEGATE: Screwdown valve that has a wedge shaped plate fitting into tapered guides to form a seal.</Definition>
