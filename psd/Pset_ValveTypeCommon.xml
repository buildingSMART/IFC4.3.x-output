      <Name>ValveMechanism</Name>
      <Definition>The mechanism by which the valve function is achieved where:\X\0D
\X\0D
BALL: Valve that has a ported ball that can be turned relative to the body seat ports.\X\0D
BUTTERFLY: Valve in which a streamlined disc pivots about a diametric axis.\X\0D
CONFIGUREDGATE: Screwdown valve in which the closing gate is shaped in a configured manner to have a more precise control of pressure and flow change across the valve.\X\0D
GLAND: Valve with a tapered seating, in which a rotatable plug is retained by means of a gland and gland packing.\X\0D
GLOBE: Screwdown valve that has a spherical body.\X\0D
LUBRICATEDPLUG: Plug valve in which a lubricant is injected under pressure between the plug face and the body.\X\0D
NEEDLE: Valve for regulating the flow in or from a pipe, in which a slender cone moves along the axis of flow to close against a fixed conical seat.\X\0D
PARALLELSLIDE: Screwdown valve that has a machined plate that slides in formed grooves to form a seal.\X\0D
PLUG: Valve that has a ported plug that can be turned relative to the body seat ports.\X\0D
WEDGEGATE: Screwdown valve that has a wedge shaped plate fitting into tapered guides to form a seal.</Definition>

      <Name>ValveOperation</Name>
      <Definition>The method of valve operation where:\X\0D
\X\0D
DROPWEIGHT: A valve that is closed by the action of a weighted lever being released, the weight normally being prevented from dropping by being held by a wire, the closure normally being made by the action of heat on a fusible link in the wire\X\0D
FLOAT: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a float that rises and falls with water level. The float may be a ball attached to a lever or other mechanism\X\0D
HYDRAULIC: A valve that is opened and closed by hydraulic actuation\X\0D
LEVER: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a lever rotating the gate within the valve.\X\0D
LOCKSHIELD: A valve that requires the use of a special lockshield key for opening and closing, the operating mechanism being protected by a shroud during normal operation.\X\0D
MOTORIZED: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of an electric motor on an actuator\X\0D
PNEUMATIC: A valve that is opened and closed by pneumatic actuation\X\0D
SOLENOID: A valve that is normally held open by a magnetic field in a coil acting on the gate but that is closed immediately if the electrical current generating the magnetic field is removed. \X\0D
SPRING: A valve that is normally held in position by the pressure of a spring on a plate but that may be caused to open if the pressure of the fluid is sufficient to overcome the spring pressure. \X\0D
THERMOSTATIC: A valve in which the ports are opened or closed to maintain a required predetermined temperature.\X\0D
WHEEL: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a wheel moving the gate within the valve.</Definition>

      <Name>ValvePattern</Name>
      <Definition>The configuration of the ports of a valve according to either the linear route taken by a fluid flowing through the valve or by the number of ports where:\X\0D
\X\0D
SINGLEPORT: Valve that has a single entry port from the system that it serves, the exit port being to the surrounding environment.\X\0D
ANGLED_2_PORT: Valve in which the direction of flow is changed through 90 degrees.\X\0D
STRAIGHT_2_PORT: Valve in which the flow is straight through.\X\0D
STRAIGHT_3_PORT: Valve with three separate ports.\X\0D
CROSSOVER_4_PORT: Valve with 4 separate ports.</Definition>
