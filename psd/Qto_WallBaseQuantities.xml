  <Definition>Base quantities that are common to the definition of all occurrences of walls.


## Comments

### Height

Total nominal height of the wall. It should only be provided, if it is constant along the wall path.

### Length

Along center line (even if different to the wall path).

### NetVolume

Volume of the wall, after subtracting the openings and after considering the connection geometry.

### Width

Measured perpendicular to the wall path. It should only be provided, if it is constant along the wall path.</Definition>
