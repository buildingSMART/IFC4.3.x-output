msgid "IfcDoorLiningProperties_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The door lining is the frame which enables the door leaf to be fixed in position. The door lining is used to hang the door leaf. The parameters of the door lining define the geometrically relevant parameter of the lining. NOTE The [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] shall only be applied by the receiving application to parametrically define the 3D shape of a door, if the attribute [[IfcDoorType]] .ParameterTakesPrecedence is set TRUE. The [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] are included in the list of properties of [[IfcDoorType]] .HasPropertySets. More information about the door lining can be included in the same list of the IfcDoorTyype using another [[IfcPropertySet]] for dynamic extensions. The [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] does not hold its own geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type which is inserted by the [[IfcDoor]] into the spatial context of the project as described below. The parameters of the [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] define a standard door lining, including if given a threshold and a transom. The outer boundary of the lining is determined by the Profile shape representation assigned to the [[IfcDoor]] , which inserts the [[IfcDoorType]] . lining 1 .. .. .. .. figures ifcdoorliningproperties fig01.png The lining is applied to the left, right and upper side of the opening reveal. The parameters are LiningDepth, if omited, equal to wall thickness this only takes effect if a value for LiningThickness is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no lining. LiningThickness LiningToPanelOffsetX LiningToPanelOffsetY NOTE The parameters LiningToPanelOffsetX and LiningToPanelOffsetY are added in IFC4. lining 2 .. .. .. .. figures ifcdoorliningproperties fig02.png The lining can only cover part of the opening reveal. LiningOffset, given if lining edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement. NOTE In addition to the LiningOffset, the local placement of the [[IfcDoor]] can already have an offset to the wall edge and thereby shift the lining along the y axis. The actual position of the lining is calculated from the origin of the local placement along the positive y axis with the distance given by LiningOffset. lining 3 .. .. .. .. figures ifcdoorliningproperties fig03.png The lining may include a casing, which covers part of the wall faces around the opening. The casing covers the left, right and upper side of the lining on both sides of the wall. The parameters are CasingDepth CasingThickness lining 4 .. .. .. .. figures ifcdoorliningproperties fig04.png The lining may include a threshold, which covers the bottom side of the opening. The parameters are ThresholdDepth, if omited, equal to wall thickness this only takes effect if a value for ThresholdThickness is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no threshold. ThresholdThickness ThresholdOffset not shown in figure , given, if the threshold edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement. lining 5 .. .. .. .. figures ifcdoorliningproperties fig05.png The lining may have a transom which separates the door panel from a window panel. The transom, if given, is defined by TransomOffset, a parallel edge to the x axis of the local placement TransomThickness The depth of the transom is identical to the depth of the lining and not given as separate parameter. NOTE LiningDepth describes the length of the lining along the reveal of the door opening. It can be given by an absolute value if the door lining has a specific depth depending on the door style. However often it is equal to the wall thickness. If the same door style is used like the same type of single swing door , but inserted into different walls with different thicknesses, it would be necessary to create a special door style for each wall thickness. Therefore several CAD systems allow to set the value to automatically aligned to wall thickness. This should be exchanged by leaving the optional attribute LiningDepth unassigned. The same agreement applies to ThresholdDepth . HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0.

msgstr "A door panel is normally a door leaf that opens to allow people or goods to pass. The parameters of the door panel define the geometrically relevant parameter of the panel, The [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of door panels. The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the door. The [[IfcDoorType]] can define doors consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] has to be included for each door panel. The PanelPosition attribute, in conjunction with the IfcDoorStyle.OperationType attribute, determines to which panel the [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] apply. The [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] are included in the list of properties , given by attribute HasPropertySets of the [[IfcDoorType]] . More information about the door panel can be included in the same list of the IfcDoorStyle using the [[IfcPropertySet]] for dynamic extensions. The [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] does not hold a geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type which is inserted by the [[IfcDoor]] into the spatial context of the project as shown in Table 1. The parameters of the [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] define a standard door panel, including if given a proportional width to define non uniform double swing or sliding, or folding doors. The outer boundary of the panel is determined by the Profile shape representation assigned to the [[IfcDoor]] , which inserts the [[IfcDoorType]] .

msgid "IfcWindowStyleOperationEnum_DEFINITION"
msgstr "This enumeration defines the basic configuration of the window type in terms of the number of window panels and the subdivision of the total window. The window configurations are given for windows with one, two or three panels including fixed panels as shown in Figure 1. Windows which are subdivided into more than three panels have to be defined by the geometry only. The type of such windows is USERDEFINED. HISTORY New Enumeration in IFC2.0. Note 1. The way how each panel operates is defined at the [[IfcWindowPanelProperties]].OperationType . 2. The reference from the window panel to the location of that panel in the window style configuration is handled by the [[IfcWindowPanelProperties]].PanelPosition . 3. The figures are shown as elevations in the XZ plane of the local placement of the window, looking into the direction of the positive Y axis. 4.
