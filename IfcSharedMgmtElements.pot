msgid "IfcCostItem"
msgstr "IfcCostItem"

msgid "IfcCostItem_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcCostItem]] describes a cost or financial value together with descriptive information that describes its context in a form that enables it to be used within a cost schedule. An [[IfcCostItem]] can be used to represent the cost of goods and services, the execution of works by a process, lifecycle cost and more. X 0D X 0D Each instance of [[IfcCostItem]] may have a name and a description. Depending on the use for which the cost is intended, these values should be asserted on the basis of agreement. For instance, the Name attribute could be used to provide a common value that enables distinct instances to be brought together in a nesting arrangement see below while the Description attribute may be used to provide text used for item description in a costing schedule. X 0D X 0D An [[IfcCostItem]] can link one or many [[IfcCostValue]] s representing a unit cost, total cost, or a unit cost with one or many quantities used to generate the total cost. The quantities can be given as individual quantities, or those quantities are provided as element quantities by one or many building elements. The [[IfcCostValue]].CostType attribute indicates the category of cost, which may be used to present the value in a particular column. For nested cost items having [[IfcRelNests]] relationship , [[IfcCostValue]].CostType is significant such that [[IfcCostValue]].AppliedValue is calculated as the sum of all nested costs having the same [[IfcCostValue]].CostType or if set to an asterisk , then the sum of all nested costs of all cost types. An [[IfcCostValue]] may represent an original value or a value derived from formulas using IfcAppliedValueRelationship . For example, taxes may be calculated as a percentage of a subtotal.
