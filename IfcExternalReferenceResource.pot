msgid "IfcClassification_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcClassification]] is used for the arrangement of objects into a class or category according to a common purpose or their possession of common characteristics. A classification in the sense of [[IfcClassification]] is taxonomy, or taxonomic scheme, arranged in a hierarchical structure. A category of objects relates to other categories in a generalization specialization relationship. Therefore the classification items in an classification are organized in a tree structure. X 0D X 0D The [[IfcClassification]] identifies the classification system or source to which a classification reference refers to. Each classification reference may reference an instance of [[IfcClassification]] . A classification system declared may be either formally published, or it may be a locally defined method of classifiying information. X 0D X 0D NOTE Examples for such formally published classifications are Omniclass, Uniclass, Masterformat, or DIN277. X 0D X 0D There are two methods to define and reference a classification system X 0D X 0D 1. Including the classification system structure within the dataset Here a hierarchical tree of [[IfcClassificationReference]] s is included that defines the classification system including the relationship between the classification items. The ReferencedSource attribute of [[IfcClassificationReference]] links the classification item to the parent item, and the parent item finally to the [[IfcClassification]] . X 0D 2. Referencing the classification system by a classification key or id Here the [[IfcClassificationReference]] is used to assign a classification id or key as Identification attribute and it may link by ReferencedSource attribute directly to the [[IfcClassification]] .

X 0D X 0D EXAMPLE The [[IfcClassificationReference]] can be used as a form of lightweight classification through the Identification attribute inherited from the abstract [[IfcExternalReference]] class. In this case, the Identification could take for instance the Uniclass notation L6814 which, if the classification was well understood by all parties and was known to be taken from a particular classification source, would be sufficient. The Name attribute could be the title Tanking . This would remove the need for the overhead of the more complete classification structure of the model. X 0D X 0D HISTORY New entity in IFC2x.

For example an element, such as [[IfcTank]] , might be further classified by assigning an [[IfcClassificationReference]] with Identification L6814 and a ClassificationSource identifying the appropriate version of Uniclass. [[IfcClassification]] should only be selected in circumstances where there could be a need to indicate the classification system that will be used without associating a notation or reference to an individual object. This may occur for higher level objects such as [[IfcProject]] , [[IfcSystem]] , or similar. For example an [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] might be classified to be applicable to a particular version of EuroCode.
