msgid "IfcRelSequence_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcRelSequence]] is a sequential relationship between processes where one process must occur before the other in time and where the timing of the relationship may be described as a type of sequence. The relating process [[IfcRelSequence]].RelatingProcess is considered to be the predecessor in the relationship has precedence whilst the related process [[IfcRelSequence]].RelatedProcess is the successor. [[IfcRelSequence]] is defined as one to one relationship therefore it assigns one predecessor to one successor. HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Relocated to IfcProcessExtension schema. TimeLag and SequenceType made optional. USERDEFINED added to the IfcSequenceType enumeration. UserDefinedSequenceType attribute added. WHERE rule controlling use of the USERDEFINED enumeration added. .use head Use definitions [[IfcRelSequence]] is used to describe the logical sequence relationship that exists between two processes. This logical relationship identifies that there is a predecessor or relating process and a successor or related process. In IFC, there may be one predecessor and one successor in the relationship. Many occurrences of [[IfcRelSequence]] may exist to describe the sequence relationships of a predecessor task with many successor tasks or of many predecessor tasks with one successor task, thus enabling a m n sequence relationship between tasks. Please note that sequence relationships can be used to define dependencies between process occurrences but also between process types for further information see [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] and [[IfcTaskType]] . In case of defining dependencies between process occurrences sequence relationships should stay within the limits of a directed, non cyclic graph. A sequence type may be set for a sequence. For tasks assigned to a work schedule, it is expected that the sequence type will be asserted. For a process map, where the sequence relationship between processes is simply a logical flow, it need not be asserted. A time lag may be assigned to a sequence, and the sequence type defines the way in which the time lag applies to the sequence either as a ratio or percentage of time duration e.g. start successor task when predecessor is 50 complete or as a time measure e.g. start successor task 1 week after commencement of the predecessor task . Care should be used when assigning a time lag to a sequence depending on the setting of the sequence type since there is no checking that the time lag value is in keeping with the sequence type set."

msgid "IfcTask_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcTask]] is an identifiable unit of work to be carried out in a construction project. A task is typically used to describe an activity for the construction or installation of products, but is not limited to these types. For example it might be used to describe design processes, move operations and other design, construction and operation related activities as well. Quantities of resources consumed by the task are dealt with by defining the [[IfcElementQuantity]] for the resource and not at the instance of [[IfcTask]] . HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0. Renamed from IfcWorkTask in IFC2x. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Attributes TaskTime and PredefinedType added. IfcMove and IfcOrderRequest has been removed in IFC4 and are now represented by [[IfcTask]] . IfcRelAssignsTasks relationship has been removed as well. .use head Attribute use definition Each occurrence of [[IfcTask]] is given a name that is indicative of its content [[IfcRoot]].Name . A textual description of the task may be provided and this may be further elaborated by a narrative long description [[IfcProcess]].LongDescription . A work method may be declared for the method of work used in carrying out a task. A task is identified as being either a milestone task or not. A milestone task is defined by the marker IsMilestone . and has no duration. A status and priority for each task may also be set. .use head Time and duration use definition Compared to previous IFC releases, basic task time information scheduled start time, scheduled finish time, duration is now directly attached to [[IfcTask]] through the TaskTime attribute. Regular tasks are defined through [[IfcTaskTime]] . Recurring tasks are defined through [[IfcTaskTimeRecurring]] . In case a regular task is derived from a recurring task both tasks should be linked together through a [[IfcRelNests]] relationship, where [[IfcRelNests]].IsNestedBy points to the recurring task and [[IfcRelNests]].Nests points to all regular tasks that have been derived from the recurring task. .use head Representation of other activities The use definitions for [[IfcTask]] have been generalised to represent other activities as well, including activities that had been defined by own entities in previous IFC releases. This includes Order actions Move operations [[IfcTask]] represents an order that might be carried out by a Helpdesk acting the role of interface for the organization between the facility user and the functional requirement of fulfilling their needs. The actual task represented by the [[IfcTask]] entity is turning a request into an order and initiating the action that will enable the order to be completed. The [[IfcProjectOrder]] or one of its subtypes including maintenance work order, is related to the [[IfcTask]] using [[IfcRelAssignsToControl]] . [[IfcTask]] can also be used to describe an activity that moves people, groups within an organization or complete organizations together with their associated furniture and equipment from one place to another. It thus replaces the previous IFC entity IfcMove. The functionality is represented in [[IfcTask]] as follows Move from The place from which actors and their associated equipment are moving. Use [[IfcRelAssignsToProcess]] where RelatingProcess points to the task and RelatedObjects holds the location s from which to move. Move to The place to which actors and their associated equipment are moving. Use [[IfcRelAssignsToProduct]] where RelatedObjects points to the task s and RelatingProduct points to the location to which to move.

msgid "IfcWorkCalendar_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcWorkCalendar]] defines working and non working time periods for tasks and resources. It enables to define both specific time periods, such as from 7 00 till 12 00 on 25th August 2009, as well as repetitive time periods based on frequently used recurrence patterns, such as each Monday from 7 00 till 12 00 between 1st March 2009 and 31st December 2009. HISTORY New entity in IFC4. A work calendar is a subtype of [[IfcControl]] and thus inherits the feature for controlling other objects through [[IfcRelAssignsToControl]] , which is used to define a work calendar for tasks [[IfcTask]] and resources [[IfcResource]] . It also inherits a name and description attribute, whereas a name shall be given and a description may be given as an indication of its content and usage. The definition of time periods can be derived from a base calendar and or modified defined by a set of working times and non working exception times. All time periods defined by [[IfcWorkCalendar]].ExceptionTimes override the time periods inherited from the base calendar base calendar is defined as the next applicable calendar for the task or resource . Thus, exception times replace the working times from the base calendar. Figure 1 shows the definition of a work calendar, which is defined by a set of work times and exception times. The work times are defined as recurring patterns with optional boundaries applying from and or to a specific date . The shown example defines a simple work calendar with working times Monday to Thursday 8 00 to 12 00 and 13 00 to 17 00, Friday 8 00 to 14 00 and as exception every 1st Monday in a month the work starts one hour later i.e. the working time on every 1st Monday in a month is overriden to be 9 00 to 12 00 and 13 00 to 17 00. Both the working time and the exception time is valid for the period of 01.09.2010 till 30.08.2011. task type instantiation diagram .. .. .. .. figures ifcworkcalendar instantiation diagram.png Figure 1 Work calendar instantiation"

Identifier has been renamed now Identification and promoted to supertype [[IfcControl]] A work control may have resources assigned to it. This is handled by the [[IfcRelAssignsToControl]] relationship. A work control should also define a context that gives further information about its usage. If no special context information is required then the [[IfcProject]] instance as a global context should be used instead. An explicit link between the work control and the [[IfcProject]] via [[IfcRelDeclares]] should then be provided. The attribute [[IfcWorkControl]].Purpose is used to define the purpose of either a work schedule or a work plan.
