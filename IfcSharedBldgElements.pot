msgid "IfcBeam_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcBeam]] is a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, structural member that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending. It represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing. .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO 6707 1 structural member for carrying load s between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so. NOTE The representation of load bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of [[IfcStructuralMember]] with [[IfcStructuralCurveMember]] being mostly applicable as part of an [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] . NOTE For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity [[IfcMember]] should be used. The camber of a beam may be defined by assigning a StructuralCurveMember with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction. There are two entities for beam occurrences [[IfcBeamStandardCase]] used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] . These beams are always represented geometricly by an Axis and a SweptSolid or AdvancedSweptSolid shape representation or by a Clipping geometry based on the swept solid , if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] assigned. NOTE Model view definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, for example, by excluding tapering from an [[IfcBeamStandardCase]] implementation. [[IfcBeam]] used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only AdvancedBrep , Brep , SurfaceModel , or Tessellation geometry. NOTE Model view definitions and implementer agreements may impose the use of [[IfcBeam]] in all cases by excluding [[IfcBeamStandardCase]] from scope of the model view. HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0"

The [[IfcWindow]] defines a particular occurrence of a window inserted in the spatial context of a project. A window can be inserted into an [[IfcOpeningElement]] using the [[IfcRelFillsElement]] relationship, then the [[IfcWindow]] has an inverse attribute FillsVoids provided, be part of an element assembly, often an [[IfcCurtainWall]] , using the [[IfcRelAggregates]] relationship, then the inverse attribute Decomposes is provided. or be a free standing window, then the [[IfcWindow]] has no inverse attributes FillsVoids or Decomposes provided. NOTE View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict the relationship to only include one window or door into one opening. There are two entities for window occurrences [[IfcWindowStandardCase]] used for all occurrences of windows, that have a Profile shape representation defined to which a set of shape parameters for lining and framing properties apply.
