msgid "IfcCoordinateOperation_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The coordinate operation is an abstract supertype to handle any operation transformation or conversion between two coordinate reference systems. It is meant to provide expandability for future versions, since currently only the conversion of a local engineering coordinate system into a map coordinate reference system is dealt with by the subtype [[IfcMapConversion]] . By convention, a coordinate operation is given between the SourceCRS being the more local, or child coordinate reference system, and the TargetCRS being the more remote or parent coordinate reference system, in the special case the coordinate operation between the local engineering coordinate system of the construction project and any map or other coordinate reference system. .extDef NOTE Definition from OpenGIS Abstract Specification, Topic 2 If the relationship between any two coordinate reference systems is known, coordinates can be transformed or converted to another coordinate reference system. Coordinate operations are divided into two subtypes .note Coordinate conversion mathematical operation on coordinates that does not include any change of datum. The best known example of a coordinate conversion is a map projection. The parameters describing coordinate conversions are defined rather than empirically derived. Note that some conversions have no parameters. Coordinate transformation mathematical operation on coordinates that usually includes a change of datum. The parameters of a coordinate transformation are empirically derived from data containing the coordinates of a series of points in both coordinate reference systems. This computational process is usually over determined , allowing derivation of error or accuracy estimates for the transformation. Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result in multiple different versions of the same coordinate transformation. Because of this several transformations may exist for a given pair of coordinate reference systems, differing in their transformation method, parameter values and accuracy characteristics.

msgstr "The [[IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem]] is a definition of a coordinate reference system by means of qualified identifiers only. The interpretation of the identifier is expected to be well known to the receiving software. .extDef NOTE Definition from OpenGIS Abstract Specification, Topic 2 A coordinate reference system is a coordinate system which is related to the real world by a datum. The coordinate system is composed of a set of coordinate axes with specified units of measure. The datum specifies the relationship of a coordinate system to the earth. The resulting combination of coordinate system and datum is a coordinate reference system. The unambiguous identifier by which the coordinate reference system is know, is stored in the Name attribute. Well defined identifiers include the geodetic and often also the vertical datum. In these cases the GeodeticDatum and the VerticalDatum can be omitted. EXAMPLE The identifier EPSG 25832 defines the geodetic datum ETRS89 in additon to the projection and the zone. EPSG 5555 defined the geodetic datum ETRS89 and the vertical datum DHHN92 . NOTE One widely used, publicly available authority is the European Petroleum Survey Group EPSG , and use of this authority is currently specified in several OGC Implementation Specifications. Software used to transport IFC engineering models into GIS applications and vice versa is expected to have knowledge about the OGC Implementation Specifications. HISTORY New entity in IFC4."

It defines the type of the context in which the shape representation is defined, and the numeric precision applicable to the geometric representation items defined in this context. In addition it can be used to offset the project coordinate system from a global point of origin, using the WorldCoordinateSystem attribute. The main representation context may also provide the true north direction, see Figure 1. The TrueNorth attribute should be provided, if the y axis of the WorldCoordinateSystem does not point to the global northing. Direction of the true north, or geographic northing direction, relative to the underlying project coordinate system as established by the attribute WorldCoordinateSystem. It is given by a 2 dimensional direction within the xy plane of the project coordinate system. If not resent, it defaults to 0.,1. i.e. the positive Y axis of the project coordinate system equals the geographic northing direction. The direction is provided within project coordinate system and identifies the true north direction. The true North as seen in CAD within the figure on the left shows the correct interpretation of the TrueNorth direction If a conversion to a geographic coordinate system is included by virtue of the HasCoordinateOperation attribute, then the TrueNorth attribute shall be omitted or included only for informational purposes. It shall not be added to any transformation already applied by an [[IfcCoordinateOperation]]. Figure 1 Definition of the true north direction The use of one instance of [[IfcGeometricRepresentationContext]] to represent the model 3D view is mandatory, the use of a second instance of [[IfcGeometricRepresentationContext]] to represent the plan 2D view is optional but needs to be given, if there are scale dependent plan views , the additional scale or view dependent contexts need to be handled by using the subtype [[IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext]] pointing to the model view or the plan view as the ParentContext .

The MapProjection and MapZone attributes uniquely identify the projection to the underlying geographic coordinate reference system, provided that they are well known in the receiving application. The projected coordinate reference system is assumed to be a 2D or 3D right handed Cartesian coordinate system, the optional MapUnit attribute can be used determine the length unit used by the map. .extDef NOTE Definition from OpenGIS Abstract Specification, Topic 2 A 2D or with vertical coordinate axis 3D coordinate reference system used to approximate the shape of the earth on a planar surface, but in such a way that the distortion that is inherent to the approximation is carefully controlled and known. Distortion correction is commonly applied to calculated bearings and distances to produce values that are a close match to actual field values. The unambiguous identifier by which the coordinate reference system is know, is stored in the inherited Name attribute. Well defined identifiers include the map projection and also the map zone information. In these cases the MapProjection and the MapZone attributes can be omitted.
