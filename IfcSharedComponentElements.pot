msgstr "[[IfcBuildingElementPart]] represents major components as subordinate parts of a building element. Typical usage examples include precast concrete sandwich walls, where the layers may have different geometry representations. In this case the layered material representation does not sufficiently describe the element. Each layer is represented by an own instance of the [[IfcBuildingElementPart]] with its own geometry description. The kind of building element part is further specified by a corresponding instance of [[IfcBuildingElementPartType]] , referred to by [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] .

msgid "IfcElementComponent_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An element component is a representation for minor items included in, added to or connecting to or between elements, which usually are not of interest from the overall building structure viewpoint. However, these small parts may have vital and load carrying functions within the construction. These items do not provide any actual space boundaries. Typical examples of [[IfcElementComponent]] s include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories. One or several instances of subtypes of [[IfcElementComponent]] should always be accompanied by a defining instance of a respective subtype of [[IfcElementComponentType]] . The type object holds shape and material information. HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2 It is often desirable to model a number of same shaped element components by means of a single occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements. In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below. To express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level, a Qto ElementComponentPatternQuantities should be provided via [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] and contain the number of pieces which are placed by a single [[IfcElementComponent]] instance. .use head Symbolic Representation A symbolic representation is defined for a row of components or several rows of components within a single instance of [[IfcElementComponent]] . Such rows or arrays may contain possibly large numbers of individual pieces. The product definition shape consists of an [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] with the attribute values RepresentationIdentifier Row RepresentationType GeometricCurveSet and one or several curves as geometric items. The curves represent where reference points of the pieces are located. For example, such reference points may be at the heads of mechanical fasteners or at the starting point of the extrusion axis of reinforcement bars. In case of straight components bolts, nails, staples, straight reinforcement bars, or similar , the local placement of the [[IfcElementComponent]] shall be located and oriented such that the local z axis is parallel with the axes of the components. A Qto ElementComponentPatternQuantities should denote the count of pieces in the row or array and their spacing. Concepts Mapped Geometry The mapped item, [[IfcMappedItem]], should be used if appropriate as it allows for reusing the geometry definition of a type at all occurrences of the same type. A single instance of a subtype of [[IfcElementComponent]] can stand for several actual element components at once. In this case, the [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] contains as many mapped items as there are element components combined within this occurrence object. .. .. .. .. figures ifcelementcomponent multiple.png EXAMPLE Figure 304 illustrates multiple components modeled as a single occurrence object here [[IfcFastener]] Figure 304 Element component mapped representation Representation identifier and type are the same as in single mapped representation. The number of mapped items in the representation corresponds with the count of element components in the [[IfcElementQuantity]]. Property Sets for Objects"
