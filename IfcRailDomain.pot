Items RACKRAIL A rack rail is a building module for enhancing traction and break performance. BLADE A blade is a machined rail, often of special section, but fixed and or joined at the heel end to a rail to provide continuity of wheel support. The two switch rails in a set are the two inside rails. A switch rail is described as right or left hand according to whether it is part of a right hand or left hand half set of switches. Note definition from EN 13232 1 2004. GUARDRAIL A guard rail is a rail that limits risk of train derailment, normally not loaded. STOCKRAIL A stock rail is a fixed machined rail, ensuring the continuity on the main or diverging track with the switch in the open position. The machined part of the stock rail supports its switch rail in the closed position, giving continuity of line through this switch rail. The two stock rails in a set of switches are the two outside rails. A stock rail is described as right or left hand according to whether it is part of a right hand or left hand half set of switches. Note definition from EN 13232 1 2004. CHECKRAIL A check rail is a rail laid close to the gauge face of a running rail which takes part in lateral guidance of the wheel and prevents derailment in small radius curved track and switches and crossings. Note definition from EN 13481 1. RAIL A rail is a special section bar usually of steel ensuring the guidance of the wheel of a rolling stock or other heavy machineries.
