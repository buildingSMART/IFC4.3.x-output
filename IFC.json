The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional   (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz).",

Grouping relationships are not required to be hierarchical nor do they imply a dependency.A group can be referenced in a spatial structure using the relationship IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure, such as a mechanical distribution system that refers to a building.Groups are assigned to other objects (such as a process or a resource) by the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object:Process: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToProcess\nResource: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToResource\nControls: affecting the group using IfcRelAssignsToControlA group can be exchanged without having already objects within the group collection.IfcGroup does not define an own object coordinate system, nor does it have an independent shape representation.NOTE  Use IfcRelAggregates together with the appropriate subtypes of IfcProduct to define an aggregation of products that may have its own position and shape representation. This relationship shall be used to create a product breakdown structure.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0.",

It also stands for processes such as work tasks, for controls such as cost items, or for actors such as persons involved in the design process.Objects can be named, using the inherited Name attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited Description attribute. The ObjectType attribute is used:to store the user defined value for all subtypes of IfcObject, where a PredefinedType attribute is given, and its value is set to USERDEFINED.\nto provide a type information (could be seen as a very lightweight classifier) of the subtype of IfcObject, if no PredefinedType attribute is given. This is often the case, if no comprehensive list of predefined types is available.Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information.

See supertype IfcObjectDefinition for more information.\nAssignment of a type : IsTypedBy - a definition relationship IfcRelDefinesByType that uses a type definition to define the common characteristics of this occurrence, potentially including the common shape representation and common properties of all object occurrences assigned to this type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).\nAssignment of a partial type : IsDeclaredBy, Declares - a definition relationship IfcRelDefinesByObject that uses a component of a type definition (a part of a type, called the \"declaring part\") to define a component of an occurrence (part of occurrence, called the \"reflected part\"). This is also referred to as a \"deep copy\". The common characteristics of all parts in the occurrence are defined by parts in the type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).\nAssignment of property sets : IsDefinedBy - a definition relationship IfcRelDefinesByProperties that assigns property set definitions to the object occurrence.NOTE  See IfcRelDefinesByType for an explanatory figure.

A context is a specific kind of object definition as it provides the project or library context in which object types and object occurrences are defined.Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information.

The semantic of the assignment is established at the level of the subtypes of the general IfcRelAssigns relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment.\nAssociation to external resources - an association relationship (IfcRelAssociates) that refers to external sources of information (most notably a classification or document) and creates a uni-directional association. There is no dependency implied by the association.\nAggregation of other objects - an aggregation relationship (IfcRelAggregates) that establishes an unordered, spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.\nNesting of other objects - a nesting relationship (IfcRelNests) that establishes an ordered, non-spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.\nDeclaration within a context - a relationship (IfcRelDeclares) of the uppermost object definition within the object definition tree (e.g. the summary object within an object nesting tree) to the context (a project or project library). It applies the units, representation context and other context information to this object definition and all dependent ones.NOTE  The link between the uppermost object in the spatial structure tree, that is IfcSite or IfcBuilding, and the context provided by IfcProject is created using the IfcRelAggregates relationship.

Processes use resources to transform inputs into outputs. Processes are interconnected because the output from one process becomes the input for another process. In effect, processes are \"glued\" together by means of such input output relationships.Process information relates to other objects by establishing the following relationships:Nesting of processes : IfcRelNests - A process can contain sub processes and thereby be nested.\nSequencing of processes : IfcRelSequence - Processes can be placed in sequence (including overlapping for parallel tasks), and have predecessors and successors.\nAssigning process to schedules : IfcRelAssignsToControl - Activities such as tasks, and predominately summary tasks, are assigned to a work schedule.\nHaving a product assigned to the process as input : IfcRelAssignsToProcess - Products can be assigned as input to a process, such as for construction process planning.\nHaving a product assigned to the process as output : IfcRelAssignsToProduct - Products can be assigned as output to a process, such as for construction process planning.\nHaving a control assigned to the process as process control : IfcRelAssignsToProcess - Items that act as a control onto the process can be assigned to a process, such as for cost management (a cost item assigned to a work task).\nHaving a resource assigned to the process as consumed by the process : IfcRelAssignsToProcess - Items that act as a mechanism to a process, such as labor, material and equipment in cost calculations.HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0.",

An IfcProduct occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an IfcProductDefinitionShape being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items).Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype IfcElement) and spatial items (covered by the subtype IfcSpatialElement) the IfcProduct also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.Any instance of IfcProduct defines a particular occurrence of a product. The common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of IfcProduct, is handled by the IfcTypeProduct (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of IfcProduct by using the objectified relationship IfcRelDefinesByType. The IfcTypeProduct may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.NOTE  See IfcTypeProduct for how to use a common geometric representation and IfcRelDefinesByType for using and overriding common properties.On a generic level products can be assigned to processes, controls, resources, project by using the relationship objects that refer to the corresponding object:Having a control applied: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToControl linking the IfcProduct to an IfcControl\nBeing assigned to a process: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToProcess linking the IfcProduct to an IfcProcess\nBeing assigned to a resource: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToResource linking the IfcProduct to an IfcResourceEXAMPLE  An example of the control relationship is the assignment of a performance history to a distribution element. An example of process assignment relationship is the assignment of products like wall, slab, column to a construction task for construction planning. And an example of resource assignment relationship is the assignment of products to a construction resource that consumes the product.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

It is not intended to use IfcResource to model the general properties of the things themselves, while an optional linkage from IfcResource to the things to be used can be specified (specifically, the relationship from subtypes of IfcResource to IfcProduct through the IfcRelAssignsToResource relationship).There are two basic intended uses of IfcResource. First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of IfcResource, or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn't have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of IfcResource (or its subtypes) alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project.EXAMPLE  construction equipment such as earth-moving vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of IfcResource alone.Second, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of IfcResource objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the IfcResource instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced. Things that might be used as resources and that are already modeled in the IFC include physical products, people and organizations, and materials. The relationship object IfcRelAssignsToResource is provided for this approach.The inherited attribute ObjectType is used as a textual code that identifies the resource type.HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

        "Description": "For the purposes of IFC the English term \"alignment\" defines three essentially separate but closely interconnected concepts.definition of a reference system for linear positioning\nsafeguarding and optimization of the movement of vehicles - kinematic perspective\ngeometric construction of roads, railway tracks or other linear infrastructureReference system for linear positioningAn alignment is used to define a reference system to position elements mainly for linear construction works, such as roads, rails, bridges, and others. The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology.NOTE  See ISO 19148 Geographic information \u2013 Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing.Kinematic perspectiveIn the kinematic perspective focus is on the safe and optimized movement of a vehicle under the constraints induced by changes in the direction of the horizontal and the vertical layout.Geometric perspectiveIn the geometric perspective the focus is on the proper placement of horizontal and vertical segments to connect certain points along a proposed path. A huge body of knowledge has been developed over a long period of time, in many aspects predating the availability of modern computers and their software.State of the art in contemporary engineeringContemporary engineering usually establishes first a horizontal layout in a properly projected plane.\n\n\nIn a second step the vertical profile (i.e. sequence of segments with constant gradients  together with smoothing segments showing a variation in gradient) is added.\n\n\nIn the rail domain in most cases a cant layout is added to the horizontal layout to compensate a part of the unwanted lateral acceleration.\n\n\nIn a final step the proposed layout is checked against a defined set of rules, formulas and thresholds to guarantee the conformance against the regulation.The sequence of steps might change from case to case and might be repeated one or more times to achieve the economic objectives and fulfill regulatory safety requirements.Contemporary alignment design almost always implements a 2.5 dimension approach.The resulting and documented geometry might be very precise or just good enough to meet safety thresholds. This depends on factors like priorities of the management, date of the design - existing alignments might have been designed more then 50 years ago - or software tools used. Working with legacy data in a high precision BIM model requires a good understanding of these factors.Distinction between business modeling and IFC core geometryAccording to IFC modeling principles alignment entities are organised in two large parts. The two parts work together, but they can also be used independently from each otherBusiness aspects of alignment\nRepresentation with the IFC geometry resourcesBusiness aspects of alignment: Here the focus is a on a schema structure as close to business terminology as possible. It is possible to have a very detailed segment structure with many domain specific properties attached. Examples for domain specific properties are design speed or cant deficiency.Representation with IFC geometry resources: Here the focus is on using as much of the established IFC geometry entities as possible. A mapping between Business aspects and IFC geometry is proposed.IFC modellingIn IFC a single alignment must have:a horizontal alignment defined in the x/y plane of the engineering coordinate systemA single alignment may have:an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along / z coordinate space\na relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and/or at constant or variable offsets\na 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data.Alignments may be aggregated into referents (IfcReferent) or derivative alignments. Derivative alignments may be used to indicate dependent alignments, such as an alignment for a bridge that is relative to a parent alignment for a road, where the child IfcAlignment may have its shape representation set to IfcOffsetCurveByDistances that starts and ends at a span within the extent of the shape representation of the parent IfcAlignment.Alignments may be assigned to groups using IfcRelAssignsToGroup, where IfcGroup or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments.Supported shape representations of IfcAlignment are:IfcGradientCurve as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment (represented by their alignment segments)\nIfcCompositeCurve as a 2D horizontal alignment (represented by its horizontal alignment segments) without a vertical alignment\nIfcOffsetCurveByDistances as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an IfcGradientCurve or another IfcOffsetCurveByDistances\nIfcSegmentedReferenceCurve as a 3D curve defined relative to an IfcGradientCurve to incorporate the application of cant\nIfcPolyline or IfcIndexedPolyCurve as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation (such as coming from a survey)\nIfcPolyline or IfcIndexedPolyCurve as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation (such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation)The RepresentationIdentifier shall always be set to 'Axis' and the RepresentationType shall be set to either 'Curve2D' or 'Curve3D' depending on if the referenced curve is 2- or 3-dimensionalNOTE  Derivative specifications (Model View Definitions) may expand the above set to include additional supported curve types.",

So far this has only been found for clothoids and is either a so called shortened ramp (can transition is shorter than the corresponding horizontal curvature transition) or a so called \u201cscissor\u201d ramp (overlapping variations of cant on both rails with opposite direction).Application of high-performance horizontal transition bends is always combined with a cant transition with identical start and end location.In real world designs, such as slow speed sections in railway stations, exceptions to the above principles can be found. It might even happen that the inner rail is elevated relative to the outer rail.Detailed geometric modelling of the superelevation has a low priority in the existing processes in most rail companies. This will very probably change with the introduction of 3D modelling in rail design. The following list shows some use cases:Correct 3D placement of certain assets (e.g. sleepers)\nRelevant input for calculation of structural gauge space\nCorrect calculation of horizontal coordinate values for the Viennese Bend\u00ae (high performance transition bend)",

Only those presentation information, that cannot be directly related to a single product, have to be wrapped within the IfcAnnotation.If available, the annotation should be related to the spatial context of the project, by containing the annotation within the appropriate level of the building structure (site, facility, facility part or building, storey, or space). This is handled by the IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure relationship.The IfcAnnotation can provide specific 0D, 1D, and 2D geometric items as representation of the annotation, offering annotation point, curves, and surfaces. In addition to the predefined type values in IfcAnnotationTypeEnum, the following values can be used for the ObjectType (with PredefinedType attribute value USERDEFINED).Annotation point is an annotation provided by a point that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of point annotation, some suggested values are:\n\nSurveyPoint: A single survey point represented by a Cartesian point. A property set may add the conditions (method, accuracy, etc. to the survey point).\nSurveyArea: A set of survey points represented by Cartesian point. These coordinates are determined relative to the coordinates of a reference point, which acts as the datum for the survey. Properties attached apply equally to all points. The difference in elevation of the survey points enables terrain to be determined.\n\n\n\nAnnotation curve is an annotation provided by a curve that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of curve annotation, some suggested values are:\n\nContourLine: A line of constant elevation typically used on geographic maps where the spacing of lines at constant intervals of elevation may be used as an indication of slope.\nIsoBar: A line of constant pressure typically used on weather maps or to show pressure gradient in spaces, chambers or externally.\nIsoLux: A line of constant illumination typically used to show the distribution of illumination levels and/or day lighting in a space or externally.\nIsoTherm: A line of constant temperature typically used to show the distribution and effect of heating or cooling within a space or to show temperature distribution on a geographic map.\n\n\n\nAnnotation surface: is an annotation provided by a surface that has additional semantic.

This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElement which is interpreted as follow:COMPLEX: building complex\nELEMENT: building\nPARTIAL: building sectionThe IfcBuilding is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates. Figure 1 shows the IfcBuilding as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements.NOTE  Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in model view definitions.Figure 1 \u2014 Building compositionSystems, such as building service or electrical distribution systems, zonal systems, or structural analysis systems, relate to IfcBuilding by using the objectified relationship IfcRelServicesBuildings.Figure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the IfcBuilding. It is used to provide the height above sea level of the project height datum for this building, that is, the internal height 0.00. The height 0.00 is often used as a building internal reference height and equal to the floor finish level of the ground floor.total height of building, also referred to as ridge height (top of roof structure, e.g the ridge against terrain): provided by Qto_BuildingBaseQuantities with Name=\"Height\"\neaves height of building (base of roof structure, e.g the eaves against terrain): provided by Qto_BuildingBaseQuantities with Name=\"EavesHeight\"Figure 2 \u2014 Building elevationsHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0.",

This is done by using the IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the IfcRelAssociatesMaterial and IfcRelDefinesByProperties relationship.In addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type (and thereby be defined by the element type properties) using the IfcRelDefinesByType relationship. An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the facility. Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the IfcRelAggregates relationship.EXAMPLE  Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair, composed by Flights and Landings.Elements that performs the same function may be grouped by an \"Element Group By Function\".

A site may be used to erect, retrofit or turn down building(s), or for other construction related developments.NOTE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1: area of land or water where construction work or other development is undertaken.Precise geospatial information of a site shall be derived from the georeferencing entities that relate the IfcProject to the real world, using sets of datum (see IfcCoordinateOperation and IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem).In small-scale projects (e.g., building), when georeferencing is not provided as recommended above, the  Longitude, Latitude and Elevation attributes of IfcSite can be used for approximate indication of the site location. This methodology is not meant to replace precise georeferencing, but can still be useful for those use cases that do not require accurate geospatial information (e.g., sun shading simulations). If asserted, the Longitude, Latitude and Elevation establish the point in WGS84 where the point 0.,0.,0. of the LocalPlacement of IfcSite is situated.The geometrical placement of the site, defined by the IfcLocalPlacement, shall be always relative to the spatial structure element, in which this site is included, or absolute, i.e. to the world coordinate system, as established by the geometric representation context of the project. The world coordinate system, established at the IfcProject.RepresentationContexts, may include a definition of the true north within the XY plane of the world coordinate system, if provided, it can be obtained at IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.TrueNorth.A project may span over several connected or disconnected sites. Therefore site complex provides for a collection of sites included in a project. A site can also be decomposed in parts, where each part defines a site section. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElement which is interpreted as follow:COMPLEX = site complex\nELEMENT = site\nPARTIAL = site sectionFigure 1 shows the IfcSite as part of the spatial structure. In addition to the logical spatial structure, also the placement hierarchy is shown. In this example the spatial structure hierarchy and the placement hierarchy are identical.NOTE  Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.Figure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the IfcSite. It is used to provide the geographic longitude, latitude, and height above sea level for the origin of the site. The origin of the site is the local placement.The provision of longitude, latitude, height at the IfcSite for georeferencing is provided for upward compatibility reasons. It requires a single instance of IfcSite and WGS84 as coordinate reference system.For exact georeferencing (or referencing to any other geographic coordinate system other than WSG84) the entities IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem and IfcMapConversion have to be used to define an exact mapping of the project engineering coordinate system to the geographic (or map) coordinate system.reference height of site is provided by: IfcSite.RefElevation, it is given according to the height datum used at this location.\nthe reference height of each building situated at the site is given against the same height datum used at this location.\nthe elevations of each storey belonging to each building are given as local height relative to the reference height of the building.HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0.",

        "Description": "A space represents an area or volume bounded actually or theoretically. Spaces are areas or volumes that provide for certain functions within a building.A space is associated to a building storey (or in case of exterior spaces to a site). A space may span over several connected spaces. Therefore a space group provides for a collection of spaces included in a storey. A space can also be decomposed in parts, where each part defines a partial space. This is defined by the CompositionType attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElement which is interpreted as follow:COMPLEX = space group\nELEMENT = space\nPARTIAL = partial spaceNOTE  View definitions and implementation agreements may restrict spaces with the same CompositionType to be non-overlapping.\n_\nThe IfcSpace is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates.Figure 1 shows the IfcSpace as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for space related elements.NOTE  Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.The following guidelines should apply for using the Name, Description, LongName and ObjectType attributes.Name holds the unique name (or space number) from the plan.\nDescription holds any additional information field the user may have specified, there are no further recommendations.\nLongName holds the full name of the space, it is often used in addition to the Name, if a number is assigned to the room, then the descriptive name is exchanged as LongName.\nObjectType holds the space type, i.e. usually the functional category of the space .NOTE  In cases of inconsistency between the geometric representation of the IfcSpace and the combined geometric representations of the surrounding IfcRelSpaceBoundary, the geometric representation of the space should take priority over the geometric representation of the surrounding space boundaries.Figure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the IfcSpace.elevation of the space (top of construction slab) equals elevation of storey: provided by IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation relative to em>IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight\nelevation of the space flooring (top of flooring on top of slab): provided by IfcSpace.ElevationWithFlooring relative to IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight\nheight of space (top of slab below to bottom of slab above): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=\"Height\"\nfloor height of space (top of slab below to top of flooring): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=\"FinishFloorHeight\"\nnet height of space (top of flooring to bottom of suspended ceiling): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=\"FinishCeilingHeight\"HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

That spatial structure is often used to provide a project structure to organize a building project.A spatial project structure might define as many levels of decomposition as necessary for the building project. Elements within the spatial project structure are:site as IfcSite\n\nfacility as IfcFacility, or specifically\n\nbuilding as IfcBuilding\nbridge as IfcBridge\nmarine facility as IfcMarineFacility\nrailway as IfcRailway\nroad as IfcRoad\n\n\n\nfacility part as IfcFacilityPart, or specifically\n\nstorey as IfcBuildingStorey\nfacility part as IfcFacilityPart\n\n\n\nspace as IfcSpaceor aggregations or parts thereof. The composition type declares an element to be either an element itself, or an aggregation (complex) or a decomposition (part). The interpretation of these types is given at each subtype of IfcSpatialStructureElement.The IfcRelAggregates is defined as an 1-to-many relationship and used to establish the relationship between exactly two levels within the spatial project structure. Finally the highest level of the spatial structure is assigned to IfcProject using the IfcRelAggregates.The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to other elements and systems by establishing the following relationships:Containment of elements : IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ContainsElements, used to assign any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. to the spatial structure element in which they are primarily contained.\nReference of elements : IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ReferencesElements, used to reference any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. in spatial structure elements, other then the one, where it is contained.\nReference of systems : IfcRelServicesBuildings by inverse attribute ServicedBySystems, used to reference a system, like a building service or electrical distribution system, a zonal system, or a structural analysis system, that is assigned to this spatial structure element.The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to each other by using the IfcRelAggregates relationship to build the project spatial structure. Figure 1 shows the use of IfcRelAggregates to establish a spatial structure including site, building, building section and storey.

It maybe included as a part of the IfcTransportElement by virtue of the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates.Transport element can describe fixed or non fixed elements, which can either be identified as specified operational assets within a facility or vehicles that interact with the facility as a user or customer.\nIn the case of operational assets, instances of IfcTransportElement can represent individual identifiable vehicles or structures with properties such as serial numbers, registration numbers etc. and be typed accordingly by instances of IfcTransportElementType.In the case transport elements that interact as users or customers, such as cars on a road or vessels at a port, IfcTransportElementType is used to define element specifications which are used to design, analyse and provide operational constraints to the facility.Depending on local classification systems transport elements and transportation systems in buildings are either considered as part of a built system, or as part of a built service system.

The boundary is exhanged using PredefinedType = BOUNDARY.\nA provision for voids. Such as where a particular volume of space is requested by an engineering function that might later be accepted or rejected. If accepted it is transformed into a void within a building element, like a wall opening, or a slab opening. The provision for voids is exchanged using the PredefinedType = PROVISIONFORVOID. Typically this shall use a swept solid geometry, where the profile of the swept solid lies on/near the surface of the referred building element and the extrusion depths is equal to or bigger then (in case of round or otherwise irregular element shape) the thickness of the building element. The appropriate property set Pset_ProvisionForVoid should be attached.\nA clearance space. Typically a placeholder for the necessary space allocation for future designed elements, such as mechanical equipment that will be determined in a later design phase.

It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry.Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters.\nArbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries.\nDerived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available.\nIn addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile.HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef.",

It may also represent such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing.There are two main representations for beam occurrences:IfcBeam with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might change uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. These beams are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\nIfcBeam without IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non-uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only 'AdvancedBrep', 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, if a more parametric representation is not intended.For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity IfcMember should be used.REFERENCE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1: structural member for carrying load(s) between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so.\nNOTE  The entity IfcBeamStandardCase has been deleted, IfcBeam with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used instead.\nNOTE  The representation of load-bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of IfcStructuralMember (with IfcStructuralCurveMember being mostly applicable) as part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel. The camber of a beam may be defined by assigning an IfcStructuralCurveMember with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

It may also represent such a member from an architectural point of view in which case it may represent a non load bearing element. Whether it is a structural load bearing element or a non-load bearing element is determined by the Pset_ColumnCommon.LoadBearing property.There are two main representations for column occurrences:IfcColumn with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all occurrences of columns, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might change uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. These columns are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\nIfcColumn is used for all other occurrences of columns, particularly for columns with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or columns defined by non-linear extrusion, or columns having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, if a more parametric representation is not intended.For any longitudial structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity IfcMember exists.REFERENCE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1 structural member of slender form, usually vertical, that transmits to its base the forces, primarily in compression, that are applied to it.\nNOTE  The entity IfcColumnStandardCase has been deleted, IfcColumn with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used instead.\nNOTE  The representation of a column in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralCurveMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

The orientation of the member (being horizontal, vertical or sloped) is not relevant to its definition (in contrary to IfcBeam and IfcColumn). An IfcMember represents a linear structural element from an architectural or structural modeling point of view and shall be used if it cannot be expressed more specifically as either an IfcBeam or an IfcColumn.There are two main representations for member occurrences:IfcMember with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all occurrences of members, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. These members are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\nIfcMember without IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of members, particularly for members with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or members defined by non-linear extrusion, or members having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.NOTE  The representation of a member in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralCurveMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC2x2 Addendum 1.",

The location of the plate (being horizontal, vertical or sloped) is not relevant to its definition.Plates are\u00a0normally made of steel, other metallic material, or by glass panels. However the definition of IfcPlate is material independent and specific material information shall be handled by using IfcRelAssociatesMaterial to assign a material specification to the IfcPlate.Plates are often add-on parts. This is represented by the IfcRelAggregates decomposition mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as IfcPlate, into a container element such as IfcElementAssembly or IfcCurtainWall.An instance of IfcPlate should preferably get its geometric representation and material assignment through the type definition by IfcPlateType assigned using the IfcRelDefinesByType relationship. This allows identical plates in a construction to be represented by the same instance of IfcPlateType.A plate may have openings, such as voids or recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the plate using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement. The position number of a plate as often used in steel construction is assigned through the attribute IfcElement.TagThere are two main representations for plate occurrences:IfcPlate with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all occurrences of plates, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage. These plates are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\nIfcPlate without IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of plates, particularly for plates with changing thickness, or plates with non planar surfaces, and plates having only 'SurfaceModel' or 'Brep' geometry or if a more parametric representation is not intended.REFERENCE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1: thin, rigid, flat, metal product, of a thickness greater than that of a sheet.\nNOTE  The representation of a plate in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralSurfaceMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC2x2",

A ramp normally does not include steps.{ .extDef}NOTE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1: Inclined way or floor joining two surfaces at different levels.The IfcRamp shall either be represented:as a ramp assembly that aggregates all parts (ramp flight, landing, etc.) with own shape representations, or\nas a single ramp without decomposition including all shape representations directly at the ramp entity.NOTE  In case of an IfcRamp being the assembly of all parts of the ramp the aggregation is handled by the IfcRelAggregates relationship, relating an IfcRamp with the related IfcRampFlight and landings, IfcSlab with PredefinedType=LANDING. IfcRailing's belonging to the ramp may also be included into the aggregation.\nNOTE  Model View Definitions and implementer agreements may restrict the IfcRamp being an assembly to not have an independent shape representation, but to always require that the decomposed parts have a shape representation. In this case, at least the 'Body' geometric representations shall not be provided directly at IfcRamp if it is an assembly. The 'Body' geometric representation of the IfcRamp is then the sum of the 'Body' shape representation of the parts within the decomposition structure.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC2.0.",

The upper finish (flooring, roofing) and the lower finish (ceiling, suspended ceiling) are considered to be coverings. A special type of slab is the landing, described as a floor section to which one or more stair flights or ramp flights connect.A slab may have openings, such as floor openings, or recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the slab using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement. Slabs with openings that have already been modeled within the enclosing geometry may use the relationship IfcRelConnectsElements to associate the IfcSlab with embedded elements such as trap doors.There are two main representations for slab occurrences:IfcSlab with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all occurrences of slabs, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage. These slabs are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\n\n\nIfcSlab without IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of slabs, particularly for slabs with changing thickness, or slabs with non planar surfaces, and slabs having only 'SweptSolid' or 'Brep' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.REFERENCE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1: thick, flat or shaped component, usually larger than 300 mm square, used to form a covering or projecting from a building.\nNOTE \u00a0An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable or irrelevant shall be modeled as IfcPlate.\nNOTE The entity IfcSlabStandardCase has been deleted, IfcSlab with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used instead.

IfcRailing's belonging to the stair may also be included into the aggregation.\nNOTE  Model View Definitions and implementer agreements may restrict the IfcStair being an assembly to not have an independent shape representation, but to always require that the decomposed parts have a shape representation. In this case, at least the 'Body' geometric representations shall not be provided directly at IfcStair if it is an assembly. The 'Body' geometric representation of the IfcStair is then the sum of the 'Body' shape representation of the parts within the decomposition structure.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC2.0.",

Wall are usually vertical, or nearly vertical, planar elements, often designed to bear structural loads. A wall is however\u00a0not required to be load bearing.{ .extDef}A wall may have openings, such as wall openings, openings used for windows or doors, or niches and recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the wall using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement. Walls with openings that have already been modeled within the enclosing geometry may use the relationship IfcRelConnectsElements to associate the wall with embedded elements such as doors and windows.There are two main representations for all occurrences:IfcWall with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all occurrences of walls, that have a non-changing thickness along the wall path and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by a material layer set. These walls are always represented geometrically by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\n\n\nIfcWall without IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of wall, particularly for walls with changing thickness along the wall path (e.g. polygonal walls), or walls with a non-rectangular cross sections (e.g. L-shaped retaining walls), and walls having an extrusion axis that is unequal to the global Z axis of the project (i.e. non-vertical walls), or walls having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.REFERENCE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1: vertical construction usually in masonry or in concrete which bounds or subdivides a construction works and fulfils a load bearing or retaining function.\nNOTE  An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable (is not predominantly vertical), shall be modeled as IfcPlate.\nNOTE  The entity IfcWallStandardCase has been deprecated, IfcWall with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used instead. The entity IfcWallElementedCase has been deleted, IfcWall with IfcRelAggregates is used to describe occurrences of wall which are aggregated from subordinate elements, such as wall panels.\nNOTE  There is a representation of walls for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of IfcStructuralMember being part of the IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows:Impart control over flow control elements (IfcFlowController) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (IfcActuator).\nSensing elements (IfcSensor) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.\nControllers (IfcController) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.Since IfcDistributionControlElement and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (IfcDistributionFlowElement), the objectified relationship IfcRelFlowControlElements has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.The key distinction between IfcDistributionFlowElement and IfcDistributionControlElement is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between IfcFlowMeter (subtype of IfcDistributionFlowElement measuring a flow quantity) and IfcFlowInstrument (subtype of IfcDistributionControlElement measuring a flow quality), is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures (having inlet/outlet pipes for the measured substance) follows the IfcDistributionFlowElement hierarchy (and therefore IfcFlowMeter which measures the flow internally). Otherwise, if it monitors/controls but does not connect inline within the flow system (it is external or is a component of another device), then it follows the IfcDistributionControlElement hierarchy (and therefore IfcFlowInstrument which may display various attributes through connected sensors).HISTORY  New entity in IFC2.0."

The type object holds shape and material information.HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x2It is often desirable to model a number of same-shaped element components by means of a single occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements. In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below.To express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level, a Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities should be provided via IfcRelDefinesByProperties and contain the number of pieces which are placed by a single IfcElementComponent instance.{ .use-head}\nSymbolic RepresentationA symbolic representation is defined for a row of components or several rows of components within a single instance of IfcElementComponent. Such rows or arrays may contain possibly large numbers of individual pieces. The product definition shape consists of an IfcShapeRepresentation with the attribute valuesRepresentationIdentifier : 'Row'\nRepresentationType : 'GeometricCurveSet'and one or several curves as geometric items. The curves represent where reference points of the pieces are located. For example, such reference points may be at the heads of mechanical fasteners or at the starting point of the extrusion axis of reinforcement bars. In case of straight components (bolts, nails, staples, straight reinforcement bars, or similar), the local placement of the IfcElementComponent shall be located and oriented such that the local z axis is parallel with the axes of the components. A Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities should denote the count of pieces in the row or array and their spacing.",
