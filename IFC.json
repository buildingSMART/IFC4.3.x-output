        "Description": "_IfcConstructionResource_ is an abstract generalization of the different resources used in construction projects, mainly labour, material, equipment and product resources, plus subcontracted resources and aggregations such as a crew resource.\n\nA resource represents \"use of something\" and does not necessarily correspond to a single item such as a person or vehicle, but represents a pool of items having limited availability such as general labor or an equipment fleet. A resource can represent either a generic resource pool (not having any task assignment) or a task-specific resource allocation (having an _IfcTask_ assignment).\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x2.\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Modified in to promote _ResourceIdentifer_ and _ResourceGroup_ (renamed to _LongDescription_) to supertype _IfcResource_ and add attributes as described.\n\n{ .use-head}\nDeclaration use definition\n\nA root-level resource (specifically _IfcCrewResource_ or _IfcSubContractResource_) is declared within the project by _IfcRelDeclares_ where _RelatingContext_ refers to the single _IfcProject_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_, and other root-level objects within the project.\n\n{ .use-head}\nAssignment use definition\n\nA resource may be assigned to an actor by _IfcRelAssignsToActor_ where _RelatingActor_ refers to an _IfcActor_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Such relationship indicates the actor responsible for allocating the resource such as partitioning into task-specific allocations, delegating to other actors, and/or scheduling over time. Note that this assignment does not indicate the person or organization performing the work; that is indicated by _IfcRelAssignsToResource_. The actor responsible for the resource may or may not be the same as any actor(s) performing work.\n\nA resource may be assigned to a control by _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ where _RelatingProduct_ refers to an _IfcControl_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcWorkCalendar_ is assigned indicating availability of the resource, where such calendar is nested within a base calendar or an _IfcWorkPlan_ which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.\n\nA resource may be assigned to a group by _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ where _RelatingGroup_ refers to an _IfcGroup_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcAsset_ is assigned indicating the asset to be tracked, where such asset is nested within an _IfcInventory_ which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.\n\nA resource may be assigned to a product by _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ where _RelatingProduct_ refers to an _IfcProduct_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcElement_ subtype is assigned indicating the product to be constructed, where such product is connected to a spatial structure which in turn is aggregated within the _IfcProject_.\n\nA resource may be assigned to a process by _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ where _RelatingProcess_ refers to an _IfcProcess_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcTask_ is assigned indicating the task to be performed by the resource, where such task is nested within a summary task which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.\n\nA resource may have assignments of other objects using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ where _RelatingResource_ refers to the _IfcConstructionResource_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more objects such as _IfcActor_ or _IfcProduct_ subtypes. This relationship indicates specific objects assigned to fulfill resource usage.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates resource assignment.\n\n![\"Assignment Use Definition\"](../../../../figures/ifcconstructionresource-assignment.png \"Figure 1 &mdash; Construction resource assignment use\")\n\n{ .use-head}\nBaseline use definition\n\nA resource may have any number of baselines defined using the relationship _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ where _RelatingObject_ is the \"current\" resource and _RelatedObjects_ consists of multiple \"baseline\" resources, each representing a copy of the resource as it existed at an earlier point in time as shown in Figure 185. Each baseline _IfcConstructionResource_ is identified by its nested _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship to an _IfcWorkSchedule_ having _PredefinedType=BASELINE_, _IfcWorkSchedule.CreationDate_ indicating the date of the baseline, and _IfcWorkSchedule.Name_ indicating the name of the baseline.\n\n![\"Baseline Use Definition\"](../../../../figures/ifcconstructionresource-baseline.png \"Figure 2 &mdash; Construction resource baseline use\")\n"

The skillset identified may be (for instance) charge-hand, foreman, labourer, plumbers mate etc. and provides a designation of a particular level of skill. It can be used to identify the generic type of labour resource that is required for a purpose without having to be specific about the actor (person or organization) providing the resource occurrence. It may be particularly useful when creating an overall plan for a process or processes. For instance, within maintenance or work planning there may be a known task that needs to be done which is planned to require a 'chargehand pipe fitter'. There may be several such labour resources available and so the need to identify which will be used is not necessary at the planning stage.\n\nAt a later stage, individual actors can be determined for the labour resources. This is achieved through specifying the actor through _IfcActor_. The actor is then identified as the labour resource occurrence through the _IfcRelAssignsToResource.RelatedResource_ attribute. The _IfcLaborResource_ provides the _IfcRelAssignsToResource_._RelatingResource_ attribute.\n",

The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional   (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz).",

Objects are things as they appear - i.e. occurrences.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Examples of _IfcObject_ include physically tangible items such as wall, beam or covering, physically existing items such as spaces, or conceptual items such as grids or virtual boundaries. It also stands for processes such as work tasks, for controls such as cost items, or for actors such as persons involved in the design process.\n\nObjects can be named, using the inherited _Name_ attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrance. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited _Description_ attribute. The _ObjectType_ attribute is used:\n\n* to store the user defined value for all subtypes of _IfcObject_, where a _PredefinedType_ attribute is given, and its value is set to USERDEFINED.\n* to provide a type information (could be seen as a very lightweight classifier) of the subtype of _IfcObject_, if no _PredefinedType_ attribute is given. This is often the case, if no comprehensive list of predefined types is available.\n\nObjects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are several relationships in which objects can be involved:\n\n* **Association to external/internal resource information** - an association relationship that refers to external/internal sources of information. See supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_ for more information.\n* **Assignment of other objects** - an assignment relationship that refers to other types of objects. See supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_ for more information.\n* **Aggregation of other objects** - an aggregation relationship that establishes a whole/part relation. Objects can either be a whole, or a part, or both. See supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_ for more information.\n* **Assignment of a type** : _IsTypedBy_ - a definition relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_ that uses a type definition to define the common characteristics of this occurrences, potentially including the common shape representation and common properties of all object occurrences assigned to this type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).\n* **Assignment of a partial type** : _IsDeclaredBy_, _Declares_ - a definition relationship _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ that uses a component of a type definition (a part of a type, called the \"declaring part\") to define a component of an occurence (part of occurrence, called the \"reflected part\"). This is also refered to as a \"deep copy\". The common characteristics of all parts in the occurrence are defined by parts in the type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).  \n* **Assignment of property sets** : _IsDefinedBy_ - a definition relationship _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ that assignes property set definitions to the object occurrence.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; See _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for an explanatory figure. Also see there for how to override type properties by occurrence properties.

Object defintions can be named, using the inherited _Name_ attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrance. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited _Description_ attribute. A context is a specific kind of object definition as it provides the project or library context in which object types and object occurrences are defined.\n\nObjects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are four essential kinds of relationships in which object definitons (by their instantiable subtypes) can be involved:\n\n* **Assignment of other objects** - an assignment relationship (_IfcRelAssigns_) that refers to other types of objects and creates a bi-directional association. The semantic of the assignment is established at the level of the subtypes of the general _IfcRelAssigns_ relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment.\n* **Association to external resources** - an association relationship (_IfcRelAssociates_) that refers to external sources of information (most notably a classification or document) and creates a uni-directional association. There is no dependency implied by the association.\n* **Aggregation of other objects** - an aggregation relationship (_IfcRelAggregates_) that establishes an unordered, spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.\n* **Nesting of other objects** - a nesting relationship (_IfcRelNests_) that establishes an ordered, non-spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.\n* **Declaration within a context** - a relationship (_IfcRelDeclares_) of the uppermost object definition within the object definition tree (e.g. the summary object within an object nesting tree) to the context (a project or project library). It applies the units, representation context and other context information to this object definition and all dependent ones.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; The link between the uppermost object in the spatial structure tree, that is _IfcSite_ or _ifcBuilding_, and the context provided by _IfcProject_ is created using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.

An _IfcProduct_ occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The _ObjectPlacement_ attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under _Representation_ are founded. The _Representation_ is provided by an _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items).\n\nProducts include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.\n\nIn addition to physical products (covered by the subtype _IfcElement_) and spatial items (covered by the subtype _IfcSpatialElement_) the _IfcProduct_ also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.\n\nAny instance of _IfcProduct_ defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of _IfcProduct_, is handled by the _IfcTypeProduct_ (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of _IfcProduct_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_. The _IfcTypeProduct_ may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; See _IfcTypeProduct_ for how to use a common geometric representation and _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for using and overriding common properties.\n\nOn a generic level products can be assigned to processes, controls, resources, project by using the relationship objects that refer to the corresponding object:\n\n* **Having a control applied**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcControl_\n* **Being assigned to a process**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcProcess_\n* **Being assigned to a resource**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcResource_\n\n> EXAMPLE&nbsp; An example of the control relationship is the assignment of a performance history to a distribution element. An example of process assignment relationship is the assignment of products like wall, slab, column to a contruction task for construction planning. And an example of resource assignment relationship is the assignment of products to a construction resource that consumes the product.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0\n",

The project establishes the context for information to be exchanged or shared, and it may represent a construction project but does not have to. The _IfcProject_'s main purpose in an exchange structure is to provide the root instance and the context for all other information items included.\n\nThe context provided by the _IfcProject_ includes:\n\n* the default units\n* the geometric representation context for exchange structures including shape representations \n    * the project coordinate system\n    * the coordinate space dimension\n    * the precision used within the geometric representations\n    * optionally the indication of the true north\n    * optionally the map conversion between the project coordinate system and the geospatial coordinate reference system. \n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The attributes _RepresentationContexts_ and _UnitsInContext_ are made optional and are promoted to supertype _IfcContext_.\n\n{ .spec-head}\nInformal Propositions:\n\n1. There shall only be one project within the exchange context. This is enforced by the global rule _IfcSingleProjectInstance_.\n\n## Formal Propositions\n\n### HasName\nThe _Name_ attribute has to be provided for _IfcProject_. It is the short name for the project.\n\n### CorrectContext\nIf a _RepresentationContexts_ relation is provided then there shall be no instance of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ directly included in the set of _RepresentationContexts_.\n\n### NoDecomposition\nThe _IfcProject_ represents the root of the any decomposition tree. It shall therefore not be used to decompose any other object definition.\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Project Classification Information\n\n\n### Project Declaration\n\nThe IfcProject is also the context for other information about the construction project such as a work plan. Non-product structures are assigned by their first level object to IfcProject using the IfcRelDeclares relationship. The IfcProject provides the context for work plans (or other non-product based) descriptions of the construction project. It is handled by the objectified relationship IfcRelDeclares.\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The spatial structure and the schedule structure can be decomposed. For example the IfcBuilding can be decomposed into IfcBuildingStorey's, and the IfcWorkPlan can be decomposed into IfcWorkSchedule's.\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The products and tasks can be decomposed further. For example the IfcCurtainWall can be decomposed into IfcMember and IfcPlate, the IfcTask can be decomposed into other IfcTask's.\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The products and tasks can have direct linking relationships. For example the IfcCurtainWall can be assigned to a IfcTask as an input or output for a construction schedule.\n\n\nFigure 128 illustrates the use of IfcProject as context for work plans or work schedules.\n\n\n![project relationships](../../../../figuresifcproject_fig-1.png)\nFigure 128 \u2014 Project spatial and work plan structure\n\n\n\n### Project Document Information\n\n\n### Project Global Positioning\n\nThe representation context of the project refers to a global positioning, i.e. the local engineering coordinate system of the project has a mapping to a defined projected coordinate system (a rectangular map coordinate system, as used in GIS systems)\n\n\n### Project Library Information\n\n\n### Project Representation Context\n\n\n### Project Units\n\n\n### Spatial Decomposition\n\nThe IfcProject is used to reference the root of the spatial structure of a building or other construction project (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together, and to the IfcProject, by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates. \n\n\nThe following constraints are applied to using the relationshio IfcRelAggregates in context of IfcProject\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The anomaly to use the composition structure through IfcRelAggregates for assigning the uppermost spatial container to IfcProject is due to upward compatibility reasons with earlier releases of this standard.\n\n\n* IfcProject.Decomposes -- it shall be NIL, i.e. the IfcProject shall be on top of the root of the spatial structure tree.\n* IfcProject.IsDecomposedBy -- referencing (IfcSite || IfcBuilding || IfcSpatialZone) by using IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects. The IfcSite, IfcBuilding, or IfcSpatialZone being referenced shall be the root of the spatial structure.\n\n\nFigure 129 illustrates project relationships with spatial structures, elements, and element type libraries.\n\n\n![spatial decomposition relationships](../../../../figuresifcproject_fig-2.png)\nFigure 129 \u2014 Project spatial structure, products and product type library",

First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of _IfcResource_, or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn't have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of _IfcResource_ (or its subtypes) alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project.\n\n> EXAMPLE&nbsp; construction equipment such as earth-moving vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of _IfcResource_ alone.\n\nSecond, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of _IfcResource_ objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the _IfcResource_ instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced. Things that might be used as resources and that are already modeled in the IFC include physical products, people and organizations, and materials.

        "Description": "For the purposes of IFC the English term \"alignment\" defines three essentially separate but closely interconnected concepts.\n\n1. defintion of a reference system for linear positioning\n2. safeguarding and optimization of the movement of vehicles - kinematic perspective\n3. geometric construction of roads, railway tracks or other linear infrastructure\n\n**Reference system for linear positioning**\n\nAn alignment is used to define a reference system to position elements mainly for linear construction works, such as roads, rails, bridges, and others. The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology.  \n\n> NOTE&nbsp; See ISO 19148 Geographic information &ndash; Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing.  \n\n**Kinematic perspective**\n\nIn the kinematic perspective focus is on the safe and optimized movement of a vehicle under the constraints induced by changes in the direction of the horizontal and the vertical layout.\n\n**Geometric perspective**\n\nIn the geometric perspective the focus is on the proper placement of horizontal and vertical segments to connect certain points along a proposed path. A huge body of knowledge has been developed over a long period of time, in many aspects predating the availability of modern computers and their software.\n\n\n\n**State of the art in contemporary engineering**\n\n1. Contemporary engineering usually establishes first a horizontal layout in a properly projected plane.\n\n2. In a second step the vertical profile (i.e. sequence of segments with constant gradients  together with smoothing segments showing a variation in gradient) is added.\n\n3. In the rail domain in most cases a cant layout is added to the horizontal layout to compensate a part of the unwanted lateral acceleration.\n\n4. In a final step the proposed layout is checked against a defined set of rules, formulas and thresholds to guarantee the conformance against the regulation.\n\nThe sequence of steps might change from case to case and might be repeated one or more times to achieve the economic objectives and fulfill regulatory safety requirements. \n\n\nContemporary alignment design almost always implements a 2.5 dimension approach. \n\nThe resulting and documented geometry might be very precise or just good enough to meet safety thresholds. This depends on factors like priorities of the management, date of the design - existing alignments might have been designed more then 50 years ago - or software tools used. Working with legacy data in a high precision BIM model requires a good understanding of these factors.\n\n**Distinction between business modeling and IFC core geometry**\n\nAccording to IFC modeling principles alignment entities are organised in two large parts. The two parts work together, but they can also be used independently from each other\n\n1. Business aspects of alignment\n2. Representation with the IFC geometry resources\n\n**Business aspects of alignment:** Here the focus is a on a schema structure as close to business terminology as possible. It is possible to have a very detailed segment structure with many domain specific properties attached. Examples for domain specific properties are design speed or cant deficiency.\n\n**Representation with IFC geometry resources:** Here the focus is on using as much of the established IFC geometry entities as possible. A mapping between Business aspects and IFC geometry is proposed.\n\n**IFC modelling**\n\nIn IFC a single alignment must have:  \n\n* a horizontal alignment defined in the x/y plane of the engineering coordinate system  \n\nA single alignment may have: \n\n* an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along / z coordinate space  \n* a relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and/or at constant or variable offsets  \n* a 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data.  \n\nAlignments may be aggregated into referents (_IfcReferent_) or derivative alignments. Derivative alignments may be used to indicate dependent alignments, such as an alignment for a bridge that is relative to a parent alignment for a road, where the child _IfcAlignment_ may have its shape representation set to _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ that starts and ends at a span within the extent of the shape representation of the parent _IfcAlignment_.  \n\nAlignments may be assigned to groups using _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_, where _IfcGroup_ or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments.  \n\nSupported shape representations of <span class=\"self-ref\">IfcAlignment</span> are:  \n\n* _IfcGradientCurve_ as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment (represented by their alignment segments)  \n* _IfcCompositeCurve_ as a 2D horizontal alignment (represented by its horizontal alignment segments) without a vertical alignment  \n* _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcAlignmentCurve_ or another _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_  \n* _IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve_ as a 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcGradientCurve_ to incorporate the application of cant \n* _IfcPolyline_ as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation (such as coming from a survey)  \n* _IfcPolyline_ as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation (such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation)  \n\nThe _RepresentationIdentifier_ shall always be set to 'Axis' and the _RepresentationType_ shall be set to either 'Curve2D' or 'Curve3D' depending on if the referenced curve is 2- or 3-dimensional\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Derivative specifications (Model View Definitions) may expand the above set to include additional supported curve types.\n",

So far this has only been found for clothoids and is either a so called shortened ramp (can transition is shorter than the corresponding horizontal curvature transition) or a so called \u201cscissor\u201d ramp (overlapping variations of cant on both rails with opposite direction). \n\nApplication of high-performance horizontal transition bends is always combined with a cant transition with identical start and end location.\n\nIn real world designs, such as slow speed sections in railway stations, exceptions to the above principles can be found. It might even happen that the inner rail is elevated relative to the outer rail.\n\nDetailed geometric modelling of the superelevation has a low priority in the existing processes in most rail companies. This will very probably change with the introduction of 3D modelling in rail design. The following list shows some use cases:\n\n* Correct 3D placement of certain assets (e.g. sleepers)\n* Relevant input for calculation of structural gauge space\n* Correct calculation of horizontal coordinate values for the Viennese Bend\u00ae (high performance transition bend)\n\n\n\n![\"Cant and structural gauge space\"](../../figures/ifcalignmentcant_structural_gauge_and_cant.png \"Figure 2 &mdash; Cant and structural gauge space\")\n",

A property set may add the conditions (method, accuracy, etc. to the survey point).\n    *  **'SurveyArea'**: A set of survey points represented by Cartesian point. These coordinates are determined relative to the coordinates of a reference point, which acts as the datum for the survey. Properties attached apply equally to all points. The difference in elevation of the survey points enables terrain to be determined.\n\n*  **'Annotation curve'** is an annotation provided by a curve that has additional semantic.

Elements can be either assembled on site or pre-manufactured and built in on site.\n\n> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Examples of elements in a building construction context are walls, floors, windows and recesses.\n\nThe elements can be logically contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a certain level within a project structure hierarchy (site, building, storey or space). This is done by using the _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ and _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ relationship.\n\nIn addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type (and thereby be defined by the element type properties) using the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship. An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the AEC product. Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.\n\n> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair, composed by Flights and Landings.\n\nElements that performs the same function may be grouped by an \"Element Group By Function\". It is realized by an instance of _IfcGroup_ with the _ObjectType_ ='ElementGroupByFunction'.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0\n",

        "Description": "_IfcProfileDef_ is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry.\n\n* Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters.\n* Arbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries.\n* Derived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available.\n* In addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef.\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Changed from ABSTRACT to non-abstract for uses which do not require an explicitly defined geometry. Added inverse attributes _HasProperties_ and _HasExternalReference_.\n\n**Use in material association**\n\nBeams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition, by means of _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ together with _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ and _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. This way, building elements and element types with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and association.\n\nThe profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with shape representations of the respective building elements.\n\nA higher-level description of spatial aligment of the section profile of a member (such as centered, bottom-left, in the geometric centroid, and more) can be provided within _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ by means of a cardinal point reference. This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent.\n\n**Use in shape models**\n\nProfile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or sectioned spines.\n\nThe purpose of the profile definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define a uniform cross section being swept:\n\n* along a line (extrusion) using _IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion_ or _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_\n* along a circular arc (revolution) using _IfcSurfaceOfRevolution_ or _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_\n* along a directrix lying on a reference surface using _IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid_\n\nThe purpose of the profile definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype _IfcDerivedProfileDef_ is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the identity of vertices and edges.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Subtypes of the _IfcProfileDef_ contain parameterized profiles (as subtypes of _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_) which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given by explicit curve geometry (either open or closed profiles) and two special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a 2D Cartesian transformation.\n\nAn _IfcProfileDef_ is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The attribute _ProfileType_ is set to AREA. An _IfcProfileDef_ is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this case, the inside of the profile (if the curve is closed) is not part of the profile. The attribute _ProfileType_ is set to CURVE.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates use of parameterized profiles within a swept area solid.\n\n<table><tr><td>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" frame=\"border\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\n      <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" width=\"420\">\n\n<img src=\"../../../../figures/ifcprofiledef-layout1.gif\" alt=\"Example of standard profile definition\" border=\"0\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\">\n\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n\n<p><u>Position</u><br>\nThe <em>IfcProfileDef</em> is defined within the underlying\ncoordinate system which is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid\nthat uses the profile definition.

This inverse relationship is used to associate an _IfcExternalReference_ (notably _IfcClassificationReference_ or _IfcLibraryReference_) with the profile.\n\n_IfcClassificationReference_ is used to refer to a profile norm (a common standard or manufacturer's standard). In this case,\n\n* _IfcClassificationReference.ItemReference_ contains the formal profile designation from the norm. (On the other hand, _IfcProfileDef.ProfileName_ contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)\n* _IfcClassificationReference.Name_ carries the short name of the profile norm.\n* Optionally, the norm can be further described by _IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource_.\n\n_IfcLibraryReference_ is used to refer to a library which contains profile definitions. In this case,\n\n* _IfcLibraryReference.ItemReference_ contains the identifier of the profile within the library and is meant to be machine-readable (in contrast to _IfcProfileDef.ProfileName_ which should be human-readable).\n* _IfcLibraryReference.Location_ and ._Name_ or ._ReferencedLibrary_ further describe the library.\n\nIf an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the referenced classification or library.\n\n**Direct instances of _IfcProfileDef_**\n\nUsually, only subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ should be instantiated. In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes other than geometric models (e.g. for structural analysis models), it may be possible to directly instantiate _IfcProfileDef_ and further specify the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter are tracked by the inverse attribute _HasProperties_.\n",

A curtain wall is often external, but using Pset_CurtainWallCommon.IsExternal can be used to define interior curtain walls. \n\n{ .extDef}\n> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1: non load bearing wall positioned on the outside of a building and enclosing it.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0\n\nThe geometric representation of _IfcCurtainWall_ is given by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, allowing multiple geometric representations. Independent 'Body' geometric representation, as described below, should only be used when the _IfcCurtainWall_ is not defined as an aggregate. If defined as an aggregate, the geometric representation is the sum of the representations of the components within the aggregate.\n\nThe geometric representation of _IfcCurtainWall_ is defined using the following multiple shape representations for its definition:\n\n* Axis: A two-dimensional open curve (for restrictions see below) defining the axis for the curtain wall. \n    * This is an optional representation for curtain walls. \n* Body: A surface model or boundary representation model representation defining the 3D shape of the curtain wall. \n    * If the _IfcCurtainWall_ has components (referenced by _SELF\\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy_) then no independent shape representation with _RepresentationType_ = 'Body' shall be defined. The body of _IfcCurtainWall_ is then geometrically represented by the shape representation of its components. The components are accessed via _SELF\\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy[1].RelatedObjects_. \n    * If the _IfcCurtainWall_ has no components defined (empty set of _SELF\\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy_) then the _IfcCurtainWall_ may be represented by an shape representation with the _RepresentationIdentifier_ ='Body'.\n",

If an _IfcRepresentationMap_ (a block definition) is defined for the _IfcDoorType_, then the _IfcDoor_ inserts it through the _IfcMappedItem_.  \n\nThe geometric representation of _IfcDoor_ is defined using the following (potentially multiple) _IfcShapeRepresentation_'s for its _IfcProductDefinitionShape_:  \n\n* **Profile**: A 'Curve3D' consisting of a single losed curve defining the outer boundary of the door (lining). The door parametric representation uses this profile in order to apply the door lining and panel parameter. If not provided, the profile of the _IfcOpeningElement_ is taken.\n* **FootPrint**: A 'GeometricCurveSet', or 'Annotation2D' representation defining the 2D shape of the door \n* **Body**: A 'SweptSolid', 'SurfaceModel', or 'Brep' representation defining the 3D shape of the door.\n\nIn addition the parametric representation of a (limited) door shape is available by applying the parameters from _IfcDoorType_ referencing _IfcDoorLiningProperties_ and _IfcDoorPanelProperties_. The purpose of the parameter is described at those entities and below (door opening operation by door type).  \nThe overall size of the _IfcDoor_ to be used to apply the lining or panel parameter provided by the _IfcDoorType_ is determined by the IfcShapeRepresentation with the RepresentationIdentifier = 'Profile'.\n",

The IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine is given as a distance from this plane.\n* The IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.DirectionSense defines how the IfcMaterialLayer's are assigned to the reference plane. POSITIVE means in direction to the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.\n* The IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine is the distance parallel to the reference plane and always perpendicular to the base (XY) plane of the reference coordinate system. This is independent of a potential non-perpendicular extrusion given by IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection <> 0.,0.,1. A positive value of IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine would then point into the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.\n* The Thickness of each IfcMaterialLayer shall be the parallel distance (measured perpendicular to the base plane).

They are defined by an _IfcOpeningElement_ attached to the slab using the inverse relationship _HasOpenings_ pointing to _IfcRelVoidsElement_.\n\nThere are three entities for slab occurrences:\n\n* _IfcSlabStandardCase_ used for all occurrences of slabs, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_. These slabs are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ assigned.\n* _IfcSlabElementedCase_ used for occurrences of slabs which are aggregated from subordinate elements, following specific decomposition rules expressed by the mandatory use of _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.\n* _IfcSlab_ used for all other occurrences of slabs, particularly for slabs with changing thickness, or slabs with non planar surfaces, and slabs having only 'SweptSolid' or 'Brep' geometry.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0; it is a merger of the two previous entities IfcFloor, IfcRoofSlab, introduced in IFC1.0\n",

There must be an object corresponding to each type of part, however there may be single object instance indicating multiple placements (via mapping geometry) for each part, or multiple instances corresponding to each placement.

A window consists of a lining and one or several panels.\n\n{ .extDef}\n> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1  \n> Construction for closing a vertical or near vertical opening in a wall or pitched roof that will admit light and may admit fresh air.\n\nThe _IfcWindow_ defines a particular occurrence of a window inserted in the spatial context of a project. A window can:\n\n* be inserted into an _IfcOpeningElement_ using the _IfcRelFillsElement_ relationship, then the _IfcWindow_ has an inverse attribute _FillsVoids_ provided,\n* be part of an element assembly, often an _IfcCurtainWall_, using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship, then the inverse attribute _Decomposes_ is provided.\n* or be a \"free standing\" window, then the _IfcWindow_ has no inverse attributes _FillsVoids_ or _Decomposes_ provided.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict the relationship to only include one window (or door) into one opening.\n\nThere are two entities for window occurrences:\n\n* _IfcWindowStandardCase_ used for all occurrences of windows, that have a 'Profile' shape representation defined to which a set of shape parameters for lining and framing properties apply. Additionally it requires the provision of an _IfcWindowType_ that references one _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ and on to many _IfcWindowPanelProperties_. \n* _IfcWindow_ used for all other occurrences of windows, particularly for windows having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry without applying shape parameters.\n\nThe actual parameter of the window and/or its shape is defined at the _IfcWindow_ as the occurrence definition (or project instance), or by the _IfcWindowType_ as the specific definition (or project type). The following parameters are given:\n\n* at the _IfcWindow_ or _IfcWindowStandardCase_ for occurrence specific parameters. The _IfcWindow_ specifies:\n*  \n    * the window width and height\n    * the window opening direction (by the y-axis of the _ObjectPlacement_) \n* at the _IfcWindowType_ to which the _IfcWindow_ is related by the inverse relationship _IsDefinedBy_ pointing to _IfcRelDefinesByType_, for type parameters common to all occurrences of the same type.\n*  \n    * the partitioning type (single panel, double panel, tripel panel, more panels)\n    * the operation type (swing, tilt and turn, pivot revolve, fixed case ment, etc.)\n    * the window panel hinge side (by using two different styles for right and left opening windows)\n    * the construction material type\n    * the particular attributes for the lining by the _IfcWindowLiningProperties_\n    * the particular attributes for the panels by the\u00a0 _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ \n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0.\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The attributes _PredefinedType_ and _OperationType_ are added, the applicable type object has been changed to _IfcDoorType_.\n\n{ .use-head}\nParameteric Representation using parameters at _IfcWindowType_\n\nThe parameters, which define the shape of the _IfcWindow_, are given at the _IfcWindowType_ and the property sets, which are included in the _IfcWindowType_. The _IfcWindow_ only defines the local placement. The overall size of the _IfcWindow_ to be used to apply the lining or panel parameter provided by the _IfcWindowType_ is determined by the IfcShapeRepresentation with the RepresentationIdentifier = 'Profile'. Only in case of an _IfcWindow_ inserted into an _IfcOpeningElement_ using the _IfcRelFillsElement_ relatioship, having a horizontal extrusion (along the y-axis of the _IfcDoor_), the overall size is determined by the extrusion profile of the _IfcOpeningElement_.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the insertion of a window into the _IfcOpeningElement_ by creating an instance of _IfcWindow_ with _PartitioningType = DoublePanelHorizontal_. The parameters _OverallHeight_ and _OverallWidth_ show the extent of the window in the positive Z and X axis of the local placement of the window. The lining and the transom are created by the given parameters.\n\n![\"window 1\"](../../../../figures/ifcwindow-layout1.gif \"Figure 1 &mdash; Window placement\")\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the final window (DoublePanelHorizontal) with first panel having _PanelPosition = TOP_, _OperationType = BOTTOMHUNG_ and second panel having _PanelPosition = BOTTOM_ and _OperationType = TILTANDTURNLEFTHAND_.\n\n![\"window 2\"](../../../../figures/ifcwindow-layout2.gif \"Figure 2 &mdash; Window planes\")\n\n{ .use-head}\nWindow opening operation by window type\n\nThe parameters that defines the shape of the _IfcWindow_, are given at the _IfcWindowType_ and the property sets, which are included in the _IfcWindowType_. The _IfcWindow_ only defines the local placement which determines the opening direction of the window. The overall layout of the _IfcWindow_ is determined by its\u00a0_IfcWindowType.PartitioningType_. Each window panel has its own operation type, provided by _IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType_. All window panels are assumed to open into the same direction (if relevant for the particular window panel operation. The hindge side (whether a window opens to the left or to the right) is determined by the _IfcWindowPanelProperties_._OperationType_.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; \u00a0There are different conventions in different countries on how to show the symbolic presentation of the window panel operation (the \"triangles\"). Either as seen from the exterior, or from the interior side. The following figures show the symbolics from the exterior side (the convention as used predominately in Europe).\n\nFigure 3 illustrates window operation types.\n\n<table><tr><td><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"><small><img alt=\"fig 1\" src=\"../../../../figures/ifcwindow-fig01.gif\" height=\"121\" width=\"301\"><br></small></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><small>The window panel (for side hung windows) opens always\ninto the direction of the positive Y axis of the local placement.\nThe determination of whether the window opens to the left or to\nthe right is done at\n<em>IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType</em>.

These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows:\n\n* Impart control over flow control elements (_IfcFlowController_) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (_IfcActuator_).\n* Sensing elements (_IfcSensor_) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.\n* Controllers (_IfcController_) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.\n\nSince _IfcDistributionControlElement_ and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (_IfcDistributionFlowElement_), the objectified relationship _IfcRelFlowControlElements_ has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.\n\nThe key distinction between _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ and _IfcDistributionControlElement_ is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between _IfcFlowMeter_ (subtype of _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ measuring a flow quantity) and _IfcFlowInstrument_ (subtype of _IfcDistributionControlElement_ measuring a flow quality), is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures (having inlet/outlet pipes for the measured substance) follows the _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ hierarchy (and therefore _IfcFlowMeter_ which measures the flow internally). Otherwise, if it monitors/controls but does not connect inline within the flow system (it is external or is a component of another device), then it follows the _IfcDistributionControlElement_ hierarchy (and therefore _IfcFlowInstrument_ which may display various attributes through connected sensors).\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0.\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Attribute _ControlElementId_ attribute deleted; replaced by classification usage.

Typical examples of _IfcElementComponent_s include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories.\n\nOne or several instances of subtypes of _IfcElementComponent_ should always be accompanied by a defining instance of a respective subtype of _IfcElementComponentType_. The type object holds shape and material information.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x2\n\nIt is often desirable to model a number of same-shaped element components by means of a single occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements. In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below.\n\nTo express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level, a _Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities_ should be provided via _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ and contain the number of pieces which are placed by a single _IfcElementComponent_ instance.\n\n{ .use-head}\n**Symbolic Representation**\n\nA symbolic representation is defined for a row of components or several rows of components within a single instance of _IfcElementComponent_.

The product definition shape consists of an _IfcShapeRepresentation_ with the attribute values\n\n* _RepresentationIdentifier_ : 'Row'\n* _RepresentationType_ : 'GeometricCurveSet'\n\nand one or several curves as geometric items. The curves represent where reference points of the pieces are located. For example, such reference points may be at the heads of mechanical fasteners or at the starting point of the extrusion axis of reinforcement bars. In case of straight components (bolts, nails, staples, straight reinforcement bars, or similar), the local placement of the _IfcElementComponent_ shall be located and oriented such that the local z axis is parallel with the axes of the components. A _Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities_ should denote the count of pieces in the row or array and their spacing.\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Mapped Geometry\n\nThe mapped item, IfcMappedItem, should be used if appropriate as it allows for reusing the geometry definition of a type at all occurrences of the same type.\n\n\nA single instance of a subtype of IfcElementComponent can stand for several \nactual element components at once.

        "Description": "The abstract entity _IfcStructuralActivity_ combines the definition of actions (such as forces, displacements, etc.) and reactions (support reactions, internal forces, deflections, etc.) which are specified by using the basic load definitions from the _IfcStructuralLoadResource_.\n\nThe differentiation between actions and reactions is realized by instantiating objects either from subclasses of _IfcStructuralAction_ or _IfcStructuralReaction_ respectively. They inherit commonly needed attributes from the abstract superclass _IfcStructuralActivity_, notably the relationship which connects actions or reactions with connections, analysis members, or elements (subtypes of _IfcStructuralItem_ or _IfcElement_).\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Instances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which are connected with an _IfcElement_ are subject to agreements outside the scope of this specification.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; The semantics of _IfcStructuralActivity_ are only fully defined if an activity instance is connected with exactly one structural item.

This coordinate system is established by an _ObjectPlacement_. (This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the _IfcProject_'s world coordinate system.)\n* The so-called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item (connection or member). This coordinate system is established by a _Representation_ in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of _IfcStructuralItem_.\n\nRepresentation items in topology representations are always given within the _ObjectPlacement_, i.e. in so-called global coordinates (global with respect to the _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_ to which this activity belongs).\n\nLocations of the load objects in the _AppliedLoad_ attribute (if of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_) are always given in local coordinates.\n\nDirections of the load objects in the _AppliedLoad_ attribute refer to global or local coordinates according to the _GlobalOrLocal_ attribute.\n\nThe _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_ are sometimes not explicitly instantiated; instead they may be implied as described below. Global and local coordinate systems are then determined in the same way as with explicit placement and representation.\n\n****Topology Use Definitions****:\n\nInstances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which are connected with a structural item of same dimensionality, i.e.\n\n* a point action or reaction connected with a point item (_IfcStructuralPointConnection_),\n* a curve action or reaction connected with a curve item (_IfcStructuralCurveConnection_, _IfcStructuralCurveMember_), or\n* a surface action or reaction connected with a surface item (_IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection_, _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_) and which acts on the entire surface of the item and is not specified by isocontours\n\nshall not have an _ObjectPlacement_ nor a _Representation_.

It includes a placement and a product representation. The _IfcProductRepresentation_ shall be given by items in a _Representation_ of type _IfcShapeRepresentation_. Shape representation and topology representation may be combined.\n\n**Local Placement**\n\nThe local placement for _IfcStructuralActivity_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_.

The curve geometry shall be compatible with the surface geometry of the connected item. In conjunction with this surface, the curve establishes a local coordinate system of the activity:\n\n* The origin of the curve parameter u is the origin of the local coordinate system.\n* The local x direction follows the tangent on the curve and is directed like u.\n* The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal of the connected surface item.\n* The local x,y,z directions form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.\n\n> * _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Reference'\n> * _RepresentationType_: 'Edge'\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; While an _IfcEdge_ (or _IfcOrientedEdge_ with underlying _IfcEdge_) does not provide an explicit underlying curve geometry, it may be used to imply an underlying straight line as reference curve with the origin of the curve parameter at the start vertex point.\n\nInstances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which act on a single point on a curve or surface item shall have a topology representation given by an _IfcVertexPoint_, which should be the single item of _IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items_.

For example, a support reaction from one structural system may be taken over as a load onto another supporting structural system. This is expressed by means of the inverse relationship _HasAssignments_ of the reaction and an _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ relationship object. _IfcRelAssignsToProduct.Name_ is set to 'Causes' and _IfcRelAssignsToProduct.RelatingProduct_ refers to an instance of a subtype of _IfcStructuralAction_."
