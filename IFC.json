The skillset identified may be (for instance) charge-hand, foreman, labourer, plumbers mate etc. and provides a designation of a particular level of skill. It can be used to identify the generic type of labour resource that is required for a purpose without having to be specific about the actor (person or organization) providing the resource occurrence. It may be particularly useful when creating an overall plan for a process or processes. For instance, within maintenance or work planning there may be a known task that needs to be done which is planned to require a 'chargehand pipe fitter'. There may be several such labour resources available and so the need to identify which will be used is not necessary at the planning stage.At a later stage, individual actors can be determined for the labour resources. This is achieved through specifying the actor through IfcActor. The actor is then identified as the labour resource occurrence through the IfcRelAssignsToResource.RelatedResource attribute. The IfcLaborResource provides the IfcRelAssignsToResource.RelatingResource attribute.",

The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional   (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz).",

Objects within a group are\u00a0products, processes, controls, resources, actors or other groups, thus groups can be nested. An object can be part of zero, one, or many groups. Grouping relationships are not required to be hierarchical nor do they imply a dependency.Groups are assigned to other objects (such as a process or a resource) by the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object:Process: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToProcess\nResource: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToResource\nControls: affecting the group using IfcRelAssignsToControlA group can be exchanged without having already objects within the group collection.IfcGroup does not define an own object coordinate system, nor does it have an independent shape representation.NOTE  Use IfcRelAggregates together with the appropriate subtypes of IfcProduct to define an aggregation of products that may have its own position and shape representation.

Objects are things as they appear - i.e. occurrences.NOTE  Examples of IfcObject include physically tangible items such as wall, beam or covering, physically existing items such as spaces, or conceptual items such as grids or virtual boundaries. It also stands for processes such as work tasks, for controls such as cost items, or for actors such as persons involved in the design process.Objects can be named, using the inherited Name attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited Description attribute. The ObjectType attribute is used:to store the user defined value for all subtypes of IfcObject, where a PredefinedType attribute is given, and its value is set to USERDEFINED.\nto provide a type information (could be seen as a very lightweight classifier) of the subtype of IfcObject, if no PredefinedType attribute is given. This is often the case, if no comprehensive list of predefined types is available.Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are several relationships in which objects can be involved:Association to external/internal resource information - an association relationship that refers to external/internal sources of information. See supertype IfcObjectDefinition for more information.\nAssignment of other objects - an assignment relationship that refers to other types of objects. See supertype IfcObjectDefinition for more information.\nAggregation of other objects - an aggregation relationship that establishes a whole/part relation. Objects can either be a whole, or a part, or both. See supertype IfcObjectDefinition for more information.\nAssignment of a type : IsTypedBy - a definition relationship IfcRelDefinesByType that uses a type definition to define the common characteristics of this occurrences, potentially including the common shape representation and common properties of all object occurrences assigned to this type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).\nAssignment of a partial type : IsDeclaredBy, Declares - a definition relationship IfcRelDefinesByObject that uses a component of a type definition (a part of a type, called the \"declaring part\") to define a component of an occurence (part of occurrence, called the \"reflected part\"). This is also referred to as a \"deep copy\". The common characteristics of all parts in the occurrence are defined by parts in the type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).\nAssignment of property sets : IsDefinedBy - a definition relationship IfcRelDefinesByProperties that assigns property set definitions to the object occurrence.NOTE  See IfcRelDefinesByType for an explanatory figure. Also see there for how to override type properties by occurrence properties. See IfcRelDefinesByObject for an explanatory figure for the assignment of a partial type.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0{ .change-ifc2x4}IFC4 CHANGE  The inverse relationships Declares, IsDeclaredBy, and IsTypedBy have been added, types are not longer included in the IsDefinesBy relationship.

Object definitions can be named, using the inherited Name attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited Description attribute. A context is a specific kind of object definition as it provides the project or library context in which object types and object occurrences are defined.Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are four essential kinds of relationships in which object definitions (by their instantiable subtypes) can be involved:Assignment of other objects - an assignment relationship (IfcRelAssigns) that refers to other types of objects and creates a bi-directional association. The semantic of the assignment is established at the level of the subtypes of the general IfcRelAssigns relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment.\nAssociation to external resources - an association relationship (IfcRelAssociates) that refers to external sources of information (most notably a classification or document) and creates a uni-directional association. There is no dependency implied by the association.\nAggregation of other objects - an aggregation relationship (IfcRelAggregates) that establishes an unordered, spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.\nNesting of other objects - a nesting relationship (IfcRelNests) that establishes an ordered, non-spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.\nDeclaration within a context - a relationship (IfcRelDeclares) of the uppermost object definition within the object definition tree (e.g. the summary object within an object nesting tree) to the context (a project or project library). It applies the units, representation context and other context information to this object definition and all dependent ones.NOTE  The link between the uppermost object in the spatial structure tree, that is IfcSite or ifcBuilding, and the context provided by IfcProject is created using the IfcRelAggregates relationship. See IfcProject for more information.\nHISTORY  New abstract entity in IFC2x3.{ .change-ifc2x4}IFC4 CHANGE The new subtype IfcContext and the relationship to context HasContext has been added .

        "Description": "IfcProcess is defined as one individual activity or event, that is ordered in time, that has sequence relationships with other processes, which transforms input in output, and may connect to other other processes through input output relationships. An IfcProcess can be an activity (or task), or an event. It takes usually place in building construction with the intent of designing, costing, acquiring, constructing, or maintaining products or other and similar tasks or procedures. Figure 1 illustrates process relationships.{ .extDef}NOTE  Definition according to ISO9000:\nA process is a set of activities that are interrelated or that interact with one another. Processes use resources to transform inputs into outputs. Processes are interconnected because the output from one process becomes the input for another process. In effect, processes are \"glued\" together by means of such input output relationships.Process information relates to other objects by establishing the following relationships:Nesting of processes : IfcRelNests - A process can contain sub processes and thereby be nested.\nSequencing of processes : IfcRelSequence - Processes can be placed in sequence (including overlapping for parallel tasks), and have predecessors and successors.\nAssigning process to schedules : IfcRelAssignsToControl - Activities such as tasks, and predominately summary tasks, are assigned to a work schedule.\nHaving a product assigned to the process as input : IfcRelAssignsToProcess - Products can be assigned as input to a process, such as for construction process planning.\nHaving a product assigned to the process as output : IfcRelAssignsToProduct - Products can be assigned as output to a process, such as for construction process planning.\nHaving a control assigned to the process as process control : IfcRelAssignsToProcess - Items that act as a control onto the process can be assigned to a process, such as for cost management (a cost item assigned to a work task).\nHaving a resource assigned to the process as consumed by the process : IfcRelAssignsToProcess - Items that act as a mechanism to a process, such as labor, material and equipment in cost calculations.HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0.{ .change-ifc2x}IFC2x CHANGE  The attribute Productivity has been removed.{ .change-ifc2x4}IFC4 CHANGE  The attribute Identification has been promoted from subtypes IfcTask and others.",

An IfcProduct occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an IfcProductDefinitionShape being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items).Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype IfcElement) and spatial items (covered by the subtype IfcSpatialElement) the IfcProduct also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.Any instance of IfcProduct defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of IfcProduct, is handled by the IfcTypeProduct (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of IfcProduct by using the objectified relationship IfcRelDefinesByType. The IfcTypeProduct may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.NOTE  See IfcTypeProduct for how to use a common geometric representation and IfcRelDefinesByType for using and overriding common properties.On a generic level products can be assigned to processes, controls, resources, project by using the relationship objects that refer to the corresponding object:Having a control applied: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToControl linking the IfcProduct to an IfcControl\nBeing assigned to a process: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToProcess linking the IfcProduct to an IfcProcess\nBeing assigned to a resource: assigned using IfcRelAssignsToResource linking the IfcProduct to an IfcResourceEXAMPLE  An example of the control relationship is the assignment of a performance history to a distribution element. An example of process assignment relationship is the assignment of products like wall, slab, column to a construction task for construction planning. And an example of resource assignment relationship is the assignment of products to a construction resource that consumes the product.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

It is not intended to use IfcResource to model the general properties of the things themselves, while an optional linkage from IfcResource to the things to be used can be specified (specifically, the relationship from subtypes of IfcResource to IfcProduct through the IfcRelAssignsToResource relationship).There are two basic intended uses of IfcResource. First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of IfcResource, or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn't have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of IfcResource (or its subtypes) alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project.EXAMPLE  construction equipment such as earth-moving vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of IfcResource alone.Second, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of IfcResource objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the IfcResource instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced. Things that might be used as resources and that are already modeled in the IFC include physical products, people and organizations, and materials. The relationship object IfcRelAssignsToResource is provided for this approach.The inherited attribute ObjectType is used as a textual code that identifies the resource type.HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0{ .change-ifc2x}IFC2x CHANGE  The attributes BaseUnit and ResourceConsumption have been removed from the abstract entity; they are reintroduced at a lower level in the hierarchy.",

Values of these properties and the representation maps are common to all occurrences\u00a0of that product type.\u00a0The type-occurrence relationship is realized using the objectified relationship IfcRelDefinesByType.NOTE  The product representations are defined as representation maps, which may be assigned by a product instance through the representation item(s) being an IfcShapeRepresentation and having Items of type\u00a0IfcMappedItem.The representations at the occurrence level (represented by subtypes of IfcProduct) can override the specific representations at the type level:for geometric representations, a Cartesian transformation operator can be applied at the occurrence level.\nfor property sets, a property within an occurrence property set, assigned at the product occurrence, overrides the same property assigned to the product type.An IfcTypeProduct may be exchanged without being already assigned to subtypes of IfcProduct.HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x.{ .change-ifc2x4}IFC4 CHANGE  The entity IfcTypeProduct shall not be instantiated from IFC4 onwards.

The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology.NOTE  See ISO 19148 Geographic information \u2013 Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing.Kinematic perspectiveIn the kinematic perspective focus is on the safe and optimized movement of a vehicle under the constraints induced by changes in the direction of the horizontal and the vertical layout.Geometric perspectiveIn the geometric perspective the focus is on the proper placement of horizontal and vertical segments to connect certain points along a proposed path. A huge body of knowledge has been developed over a long period of time, in many aspects predating the availability of modern computers and their software.State of the art in contemporary engineeringContemporary engineering usually establishes first a horizontal layout in a properly projected plane.\n\n\nIn a second step the vertical profile (i.e. sequence of segments with constant gradients  together with smoothing segments showing a variation in gradient) is added.\n\n\nIn the rail domain in most cases a cant layout is added to the horizontal layout to compensate a part of the unwanted lateral acceleration.\n\n\nIn a final step the proposed layout is checked against a defined set of rules, formulas and thresholds to guarantee the conformance against the regulation.The sequence of steps might change from case to case and might be repeated one or more times to achieve the economic objectives and fulfill regulatory safety requirements.Contemporary alignment design almost always implements a 2.5 dimension approach.The resulting and documented geometry might be very precise or just good enough to meet safety thresholds. This depends on factors like priorities of the management, date of the design - existing alignments might have been designed more then 50 years ago - or software tools used. Working with legacy data in a high precision BIM model requires a good understanding of these factors.Distinction between business modeling and IFC core geometryAccording to IFC modeling principles alignment entities are organised in two large parts. The two parts work together, but they can also be used independently from each otherBusiness aspects of alignment\nRepresentation with the IFC geometry resourcesBusiness aspects of alignment: Here the focus is a on a schema structure as close to business terminology as possible. It is possible to have a very detailed segment structure with many domain specific properties attached. Examples for domain specific properties are design speed or cant deficiency.Representation with IFC geometry resources: Here the focus is on using as much of the established IFC geometry entities as possible. A mapping between Business aspects and IFC geometry is proposed.IFC modellingIn IFC a single alignment must have:a horizontal alignment defined in the x/y plane of the engineering coordinate systemA single alignment may have:an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along / z coordinate space\na relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and/or at constant or variable offsets\na 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data.Alignments may be aggregated into referents (IfcReferent) or derivative alignments. Derivative alignments may be used to indicate dependent alignments, such as an alignment for a bridge that is relative to a parent alignment for a road, where the child IfcAlignment may have its shape representation set to IfcOffsetCurveByDistances that starts and ends at a span within the extent of the shape representation of the parent IfcAlignment.Alignments may be assigned to groups using IfcRelAssignsToGroup, where IfcGroup or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments.Supported shape representations of IfcAlignment are:IfcGradientCurve as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment (represented by their alignment segments)\nIfcCompositeCurve as a 2D horizontal alignment (represented by its horizontal alignment segments) without a vertical alignment\nIfcOffsetCurveByDistances as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an IfcAlignmentCurve or another IfcOffsetCurveByDistances\nIfcSegmentedReferenceCurve as a 3D curve defined relative to an IfcGradientCurve to incorporate the application of cant\nIfcPolyline as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation (such as coming from a survey)\nIfcPolyline as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation (such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation)The RepresentationIdentifier shall always be set to 'Axis' and the RepresentationType shall be set to either 'Curve2D' or 'Curve3D' depending on if the referenced curve is 2- or 3-dimensionalNOTE  Derivative specifications (Model View Definitions) may expand the above set to include additional supported curve types.",

The first value is the distance along the horizontal alignment, and the second value is the height relative to the projection of the point along vertical alignment.Cant as a railway specificityNOTE figure was first published in (Basics of) Railway Curve Kinematics Presentation, (Wojtczak 2018)The diagram in the figure above shows the principle of compensating part of the lateral acceleration by elevating the outer rail relative to the inner rail of a track.Almost always the following principles for the placement of horizontal segments and cant segments are implemented:Straight horizontal line: no applied cant\nHorizontal circular arc: constant applied cant\nHorizontal transition bend: variation of applied cant according to a defined formulaIn specific difficult topographic environments like mountain lines the extension of a cant transition may differ from the horizontal transition. So far this has only been found for clothoids and is either a so called shortened ramp (can transition is shorter than the corresponding horizontal curvature transition) or a so called \u201cscissor\u201d ramp (overlapping variations of cant on both rails with opposite direction).Application of high-performance horizontal transition bends is always combined with a cant transition with identical start and end location.In real world designs, such as slow speed sections in railway stations, exceptions to the above principles can be found. It might even happen that the inner rail is elevated relative to the outer rail.Detailed geometric modelling of the superelevation has a low priority in the existing processes in most rail companies. This will very probably change with the introduction of 3D modelling in rail design. The following list shows some use cases:Correct 3D placement of certain assets (e.g. sleepers)\nRelevant input for calculation of structural gauge space\nCorrect calculation of horizontal coordinate values for the Viennese Bend\u00ae (high performance transition bend)",

It also includes virtual or symbolic representations of additional model components, not representing products or spatial structures, such as event elements, survey points, contour lines or similar.NOTE  Additional presentation information (often 2D) such as tag number or hatching, that is directly related to a particular product representation is included within the IfcProductDefinitionShape having various IfcShapeRepresentation's of the IfcElement (and its subtypes). Only those presentation information, that cannot be directly related to a single product, have to be wrapped within the IfcAnnotation.If available, the annotation should be related to the spatial context of the project, by containing the annotation within the appropriate level of the building structure (site, facility, facility part or building, storey, or space). This is handled by the IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure relationship.The IfcAnnotation can provide specific 0D, 1D, and 2D geometric items as representation of the annotation, offering annotation point, curves, and surfaces. In addition to the predefined type values in IfcAnnotationTypeEnum, the following values can be used for the ObjectType (with PredefinedType attribute value USERDEFINED).Annotation point is an annotation provided by a point that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of point annotation, some suggested values are:\n\nSurveyPoint: A single survey point represented by a Cartesian point. A property set may add the conditions (method, accuracy, etc. to the survey point).\nSurveyArea: A set of survey points represented by Cartesian point. These coordinates are determined relative to the coordinates of a reference point, which acts as the datum for the survey. Properties attached apply equally to all points. The difference in elevation of the survey points enables terrain to be determined.\n\n\n\nAnnotation curve is an annotation provided by a curve that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of curve annotation, some suggested values are:\n\nContourLine: A line of constant elevation typically used on geographic maps where the spacing of lines at constant intervals of elevation may be used as an indication of slope.\nIsoBar: A line of constant pressure typically used on weather maps or to show pressure gradient in spaces, chambers or externally.\nIsoLux: A line of constant illumination typically used to show the distribution of illumination levels and/or day lighting in a space or externally.\nIsoTherm: A line of constant temperature typically used to show the distribution and effect of heating or cooling within a space or to show temperature distribution on a geographic map.\n\n\n\nAnnotation surface: is an annotation provided by a surface that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of surface annotation, some suggested values are:\n\nSurveyArea: A surface patch based on survey points.HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x2.",

A building may span over several connected or disconnected buildings. Therefore building complex provides for a collection of buildings included in a site. A building can also be decomposed in (vertical) parts, where each part defines a building section. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElements which is interpreted as follow:COMPLEX: building complex\nELEMENT: building\nPARTIAL: building sectionThe IfcBuilding is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates. Figure 1 shows the IfcBuilding as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements.NOTE  Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.Figure 1 \u2014 Building compositionSystems, such as building service or electrical distribution systems, zonal systems, or structural analysis systems, relate to IfcBuilding by using the objectified relationship IfcRelServicesBuildings.Figure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the IfcBuilding.

This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElements which is interpreted as follow:COMPLEX: building storey complex\nELEMENT: building storey\nPARTIAL: partial building storeyEXAMPLE  In split level houses, a storey is split into two or more partial storeys, each with a different elevation. It can be handled by defining a storey, which includes two or more partial storeys with the individual elevations.The IfcBuildingStorey is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates.Figure 1 shows the IfcBuildingStorey as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements.NOTE  Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.Figure 1 \u2014 Building storey compositionFigure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the IfcBuildingStorey.elevation of the structural slab level: provided by Qto_BuildingStoreyBaseQuantities with Name=\"ElevationOfSSLRelative\"\nelevation of the finish floor level: provided by Qto_BuildingStoreyBaseQuantities with Name=\"ElevationOfFFLRelative\"\nnet height of storey, also referred to as total height or system height (top of construction slab to top of construction slab above): provided by Qto_BuildingStoreyBaseQuantities with Name=\"GrossHeight\"\nnet height of storey (top of construction slab to bottom of construction slab above): provided by Qto_BuildingStoreyBaseQuantities with Name=\"NetHeight\"HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

This is done by using the IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure relationship.

Spaces are areas or volumes that provide for certain functions within a building.A space is associated to a building storey (or in case of exterior spaces to a site). A space may span over several connected spaces. Therefore a space group provides for a collection of spaces included in a storey. A space can also be decomposed in parts, where each part defines a partial space. This is defined by the CompositionType attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElement which is interpreted as follow:COMPLEX = space group\nELEMENT = space\nPARTIAL = partial spaceNOTE  View definitions and implementation agreements may restrict spaces with CompositionType=ELEMENT to be non-overlapping.The IfcSpace is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates.Figure 1 shows the IfcSpace as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for space related elements.NOTE  Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.The following guidelines should apply for using the Name, Description, LongName and ObjectType attributes.Name holds the unique name (or space number) from the plan.\nDescription holds any additional information field the user may have specified, there are no further recommendations.\nLongName holds the full name of the space, it is often used in addition to the Name, if a number is assigned to the room, then the descriptive name is exchanged as LongName.\nObjectType holds the space type, i.e. usually the functional category of the space .NOTE  In cases of inconsistency between the geometric representation of the IfcSpace and the combined geometric representations of the surrounding IfcRelSpaceBoundary, the geometric representation of the space should take priority over the geometric representation of the surrounding space boundaries.Figure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the IfcSpace.elevation of the space (top of construction slab) equals elevation of storey: provided by IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation relative to em>IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight\nelevation of the space flooring (top of flooring on top of slab): provided by IfcSpace.ElevationWithFlooring relative to IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight\nheight of space (top of slab below to bottom of slab above): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=\"Height\"\nfloor height of space (top of slab below to top of flooring): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=\"FinishFloorHeight\"\nnet height of space (top of flooring to bottom of suspended ceiling): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=\"FinishCeilingHeight\"HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

Elements within the spatial project structure are:site as IfcSite\n\nfacility as IfcFacility, or specifically\n\nbuilding as IfcBuilding\nbridge as IfcBridge\nmarine facility as IfcMarineFacility\nrailway as IfcRailway\nroad as IfcRoad\n\n\n\nfacility part as IfcFacilityPart, or specifically\n\nstorey as IfcBuildingStorey\nfacility part as IfcFacilityPart\n\n\n\nspace as IfcSpaceor aggregations or parts thereof. The composition type declares an element to be either an element itself, or an aggregation (complex) or a decomposition (part). The interpretation of these types is given at each subtype of IfcSpatialStructureElement.The IfcRelAggregates is defined as an 1-to-many relationship and used to establish the relationship between exactly two levels within the spatial project structure. Finally the highest level of the spatial structure is assigned to IfcProject using the IfcRelAggregates.The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to other elements and systems by establishing the following relationships:Containment of elements : IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ContainsElements, used to assign any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. to the spatial structure element in which they are primarily contained.\nReference of elements : IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ReferencesElements, used to reference any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. in spatial structure elements, other then the one, where it is contained.\nReference of systems : IfcRelServicesBuildings by inverse attribute ServicedBySystems, used to reference a system, like a building service or electrical distribution system, a zonal system, or a structural analysis system, that is assigned to this spatial structure element.The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to each other by using the IfcRelAggregates relationship to build the project spatial structure.

It maybe included as a part of the IfcTransportElement by virtue of the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates.Transport element can describe fixed or non fixed elements, which can either be identified as specified operational assets within a facility or vehicles that interact with the facility as a user or customer.\nIn the case of operational assets, instances of IfcTransportElement can represent individual identifiable vehicles or structures with properties such as serial numbers, registration numbers etc. and be typed accordingly by instances of IfcTransportElementType.In the case transport elements that interact as users or customers, such as cars on a road or vessels at a port, IfcTransportElementType is used to define element specifications which are used to design, analyse and provide operational constraints to the facility.Depending on local classification systems transport elements and transportation systems in buildings are either considered as part of a built system, or as part of a built service system. Within IFC they are considered as part of a built system and may have to be mapped appropriately.HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x.{ .change-ifc2x}IFC2x CHANGE  The attribute PredefinedType (previously OperationType) is made optional.{ .change-ifc2x4}IFC4 CHANGE  The last attributes CapacityByWeight and CapacityByNumber are removed, use Pset_TransportElementCommon instead."

        "Description": "IfcProfileDef is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry.Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters.\nArbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries.\nDerived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available.\nIn addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile.HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef.{ .change-ifc2x4}IFC4 CHANGE  Changed from ABSTRACT to non-abstract for uses which do not require an explicitly defined geometry. Added inverse attributes HasProperties and HasExternalReference.Use in material associationBeams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition, by means of IfcRelAssociatesMaterial together with IfcMaterialProfileSet and IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. This way, building elements and element types with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and association.The profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with shape representations of the respective building elements.A higher-level description of spatial alignment of the section profile of a member (such as centered, bottom-left, in the geometric centroid, and more) can be provided within IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage by means of a cardinal point reference. This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent.Use in shape modelsProfile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or sectioned spines.The purpose of the profile definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define a uniform cross section being swept:along a line (extrusion) using IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion or IfcExtrudedAreaSolid\nalong a circular arc (revolution) using IfcSurfaceOfRevolution or IfcRevolvedAreaSolid\nalong a directrix lying on a reference surface using IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolidThe purpose of the profile definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype IfcDerivedProfileDef is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the identity of vertices and edges.NOTE  Subtypes of the IfcProfileDef contain parameterized profiles (as subtypes of IfcParameterizedProfileDef) which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given by explicit curve geometry (either open or closed profiles) and two special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a 2D Cartesian transformation.An IfcProfileDef is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to AREA. An IfcProfileDef is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this case, the inside of the profile (if the curve is closed) is not part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to CURVE.Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrates use of parameterized profiles within a swept area solid.Figure 1 \u2014 Example of standard profile definitionThe IfcProfileDef is defined within the underlying coordinate system which is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane:of IfcSweptSurface.Position or\nof IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position or\nof each list member of IfcSectionedSpine.CrossSectionPositions.In Figure 1 to the left, the z axis of the position coordinate system points outwards of the drawing plane.NOTE The subtype IfcParameterizedProfileDef optionally provides an additional 2D position coordinate system relative to the underlying coordinate system of the IfcProfileDef.Figure 2 \u2014 Use within swept area solidsIn the later use of the IfcProfileDef within the swept surface or swept area solid,  e.g. the IfcExtrudedAreaSolid (here used as an example), the profile boundaries (here based on the 2D position coordinate system of IfcParameterizedProfileDef) are placed within the xy plane of the 3D position coordinate system of the swept surface or swept area solid.The profile is inserted into the underlying coordinate system either:directly in case of using IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef and IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef,\nthrough an intermediate position coordinate system in case of using IfcParameterizedProfileDef.\nthrough an 2D Cartesian transformation operator (applied directly to the curve position when using arbitrary profile definitions, or applied to the position coordinate system when using parameterized profile definitions) in case of using IfcDerivedProfileDef.\nwhen using IfcCompositeProfileDef the insertion depends on the subtype of the included sub-profiles.Profile typesResults of the different usage of the ProfileType attribute are demonstrated here. The ProfileType defines whether the inside (the bounded area) is part of the profile definition (Area) or not (Curve). Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrates the resulting area or curve depending on ProfileType.Figure 3 \u2014 AREA profile type without thicknessFigure 4 \u2014 CURVE profile type with a closed curveProfile specification by external referenceIf the profile is standardized by a norm or a catalogue, a reference to this norm or catalogue should be provided by means of HasExternalReference. This inverse relationship is used to associate an IfcExternalReference (notably IfcClassificationReference or IfcLibraryReference) with the profile.IfcClassificationReference is used to refer to a profile norm (a common standard or manufacturer's standard). In this case,IfcClassificationReference.ItemReference contains the formal profile designation from the norm. (On the other hand, IfcProfileDef.ProfileName contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)\nIfcClassificationReference.Name carries the short name of the profile norm.\nOptionally, the norm can be further described by IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource.IfcLibraryReference is used to refer to a library which contains profile definitions. In this case,IfcLibraryReference.ItemReference contains the identifier of the profile within the library and is meant to be machine-readable (in contrast to IfcProfileDef.ProfileName which should be human-readable).\nIfcLibraryReference.Location and .Name or .ReferencedLibrary further describe the library.If an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the referenced classification or library.Direct instances of IfcProfileDefUsually, only subtypes of IfcProfileDef should be instantiated. In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes other than geometric models (e.g. for structural analysis models), it may be possible to directly instantiate IfcProfileDef and further specify the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter are tracked by the inverse attribute HasProperties.",

It represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing.NOTE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1: structural member for carrying load(s) between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so.There are two main representations for beam occurrences:IfcBeam with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. These beams are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\n\n\nIfcBeam without _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsag_e is used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non-uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only 'AdvancedBrep', 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.NOTE  The entity IfcBeamStandardCase has been deprecated, IfcBeam with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used instead.For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity IfcMember should be used.NOTE  The representation of load-bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of IfcStructuralMember (with IfcStructuralCurveMember being mostly applicable) as part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel. The camber of a beam may be defined by assigning an IfcStructuralCurveMember with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

If accepted it is transformed into a void within a building element, like a wall opening, or a slab opening. The provision for voids is exchanged as an IfcBuildingElementProxy with the PredefinedType = ProvisionForVoid.

These columns are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\n\n\nIfcColumn is used for all other occurrences of columns, particularly for columns with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or columns defined by non-linear extrusion, or columns having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.NOTE  The entity IfcColumnStandardCase has been deprecated, IfcColumn with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used instead.For any longitudial structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity IfcMember exists.NOTE  The representation of a column in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralCurveMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

However the definition of IfcPlate is material independent and specific material information shall be handled by using IfcAssociatesMaterial to assign a material specification to the IfcPlate.NOTE \u00a0Although not necessarily, plates are often add-on parts. This is represented by the IfcRelAggregates decomposition mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as IfcPlate, into a container element such as IfcElementAssembly or IfcCurtainWall.An instance of IfcPlate should preferably get its geometric representation and material assignment through the type definition by IfcPlateType assigned using the IfcRelDefinesByType relationship. This allows identical plates in a construction to be represented by the same instance of IfcPlateType.A plate may have openings, such as voids or recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the plate using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement. The position number of a plate as often used in steel construction is assigned through the attribute IfcElement.TagThere are two main representations for plate occurrences:IfcPlate with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all occurrences of plates, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage. These plates are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\n\n\nIfcPlate without IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of plates, particularly for plates with changing thickness, or plates with non planar surfaces, and plates having only 'SurfaceModel' or 'Brep' geometry or if a more parametric representation is not intended.NOTE  The representation of a plate in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralSurfaceMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC2x2",

IfcRailing's belonging to the ramp may also be included into the aggregation.\nNOTE  Model View Definitions and implementer agreements may restrict the IfcRamp being an assembly to not have an independent shape representation, but to always require that the decomposed parts have a shape representation. In this case, at least the 'Body' geometric representations shall not be provided directly at IfcRamp if it is an assembly. The 'Body' geometric representation of the IfcRamp is then the sum of the 'Body' shape representation of the parts within the decomposition structure.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC2.0.{ .change-ifc2x4}IFC4 CHANGE Attribute ShapeType renamed to PredefinedType",

The upper finish (flooring, roofing) and the lower finish (ceiling, suspended ceiling) are considered to be coverings. A special type of slab is the landing, described as a floor section to which one or more stair flights or ramp flights connect.NOTE \u00a0An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable or irrelevant shall be modeled as IfcPlate.A slab may have openings, such as floor openings, or recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the slab using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement.NOTE  Slabs with openings that have already been modeled within the enclosing geometry may use the relationship IfcRelConnectsElements to associate the wall with embedded elements such as trap doors.There are two main representations for slab occurrences:IfcSlab with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all occurrences of slabs, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage. These slabs are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\n\n\nIfcSlab without IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of slabs, particularly for slabs with changing thickness, or slabs with non planar surfaces, and slabs having only 'SweptSolid' or 'Brep' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.NOTE The entity IfcSlabStandardCase has been deprecated, IfcSlab with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used instead. The entity IfcSlabElementedCase has been deprecated, IfcSlab with IfcRelAggregates is used to describe occurrences of slabs which are aggregated from subordinate elements.\nNOTE There is a representation of slabs for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of IfcStructuralMember being part of the IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC2.0; it is a merger of the two previous entities IfcFloor, IfcRoofSlab, introduced in IFC1.0",

They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the wall using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement.NOTE  Walls with openings that have already been modeled within the enclosing geometry may use the relationship IfcRelConnectsElements to associate the wall with embedded elements such as doors and windows.There are two main representations for all occurrences:IfcWall with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all occurrences of walls, that have a non-changing thickness along the wall path and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by a material layer set. These walls are always represented geometrically by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.\n\n\nIfcWall without IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of wall, particularly for walls with changing thickness along the wall path (e.g. polygonal walls), or walls with a non-rectangular cross sections (e.g. L-shaped retaining walls), and walls having an extrusion axis that is unequal to the global Z axis of the project (i.e. non-vertical walls), or walls having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.NOTE  The entity IfcWallStandardCase has been deprecated, IfcWall with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used instead. The entity IfcWallElementedCase has been deprecated, IfcWall with IfcRelAggregates is used to describe occurrences of wall which are aggregated from subordinate elements, such as wall panels.\nNOTE  There is a representation of walls for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of IfcStructuralMember being part of the IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.\nHISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0",

It includes vertical opening but also horizontal opening such as skylights or light domes. It includes constructions with swinging, pivoting, sliding, or revolving panels and fixed panels. A window consists of a lining and one or several panels.{ .extDef}NOTE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1\nConstruction for closing a vertical or near vertical opening in a wall or pitched roof that will admit light and may admit fresh air.The IfcWindow defines a particular occurrence of a window inserted in the spatial context of a project. A window can:be inserted into an IfcOpeningElement using the IfcRelFillsElement relationship, then the IfcWindow has an inverse attribute FillsVoids provided,\nbe part of an element assembly, often an IfcCurtainWall, using the IfcRelAggregates relationship, then the inverse attribute Decomposes is provided.\nor be a \"free standing\" window, then the IfcWindow has no inverse attributes FillsVoids or Decomposes provided.NOTE  View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict the relationship to only include one window (or door) into one opening.There are two main representations for window occurrences:IfcWindow with a shape representation having RepresentationIdenfifier='Profile' is used for all occurrences of windows, that have a 'Profile' shape representation defined to which a set of shape parameters for lining and framing properties apply. Additionally it requires the provision of an IfcWindowType that references one IfcWindowLiningProperties and on to many IfcWindowPanelProperties.\n\n\nIfcWindow used for all other occurrences of windows, particularly for windows having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry without applying shape parameters.NOTE  The entity IfcWindowStandardCase has been deprecated.The actual parameter of the window and/or its shape is defined at the IfcWindow as the occurrence definition (or project instance), or by the IfcWindowType as the specific definition (or project type). The following parameters are given:at the IfcWindow for occurrence specific parameters.

The IfcWindow only defines the local placement. The overall size of the IfcWindow to be used to apply the lining or panel parameter provided by the IfcWindowType is determined by the IfcShapeRepresentation with the RepresentationIdentifier = 'Profile'. Only in case of an IfcWindow inserted into an IfcOpeningElement using the IfcRelFillsElement relationship, having a horizontal extrusion (along the y-axis of the IfcWindow), the overall size is determined by the extrusion profile of the IfcOpeningElement.Figure 1 illustrates the insertion of a window into the IfcOpeningElement by creating an instance of IfcWindow with PartitioningType = DoublePanelHorizontal. The parameters OverallHeight and OverallWidth show the extent of the window in the positive Z and X axis of the local placement of the window. The lining and the transom are created by the given parameters.Figure 1 \u2014 Window placementFigure 2 illustrates the final window (DoublePanelHorizontal) with first panel having PanelPosition = TOP, OperationType = BOTTOMHUNG and second panel having PanelPosition = BOTTOM and OperationType = TILTANDTURNLEFTHAND.Figure 2 \u2014 Window planes{ .use-head}\nWindow opening operation by window typeThe parameters that defines the shape of the IfcWindow, are given at the IfcWindowType and the property sets, which are included in the IfcWindowType.

Each window panel has its own operation type, provided by IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType. All window panels are assumed to open into the same direction (if relevant for the particular window panel operation. The hindge side (whether a window opens to the left or to the right) is determined by the IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType.NOTE  \u00a0There are different conventions in different countries on how to show the symbolic presentation of the window panel operation (the \"triangles\").

The following figures/ show the symbolics from the exterior side (the convention as used predominately in Europe).Table 3 illustrates window operation types.Diagram\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nThe window panel (for side hung windows) opens always into the direction of the positive Y axis of the local placement.  The determination of whether the window opens to the left or to the right is done at IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType.

It is still a left hung window, given by IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType =\u00a0SideHungLeftHand.\n\n\n\nIf the window panel (for side hung windows) opens to the right, a separate window panel style needs to be used (here IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType =\u00a0SideHungRightHand) and it always opens into the direction of the positive Y axis of the local placement.\n\n\n\nIf the window should open to the other side, then the local placement has to be changed.

These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows:Impart control over flow control elements (IfcFlowController) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (IfcActuator).\nSensing elements (IfcSensor) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.\nControllers (IfcController) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.Since IfcDistributionControlElement and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (IfcDistributionFlowElement), the objectified relationship IfcRelFlowControlElements has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.The key distinction between IfcDistributionFlowElement and IfcDistributionControlElement is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between IfcFlowMeter (subtype of IfcDistributionFlowElement measuring a flow quantity) and IfcFlowInstrument (subtype of IfcDistributionControlElement measuring a flow quality), is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures (having inlet/outlet pipes for the measured substance) follows the IfcDistributionFlowElement hierarchy (and therefore IfcFlowMeter which measures the flow internally). Otherwise, if it monitors/controls but does not connect inline within the flow system (it is external or is a component of another device), then it follows the IfcDistributionControlElement hierarchy (and therefore IfcFlowInstrument which may display various attributes through connected sensors).HISTORY  New entity in IFC2.0.{ .change-ifc2x4}IFC4 CHANGE  Attribute ControlElementId attribute deleted; replaced by classification usage.

The volume and mass of the element may be increased, remain unchanged, or be decreased by the surface feature, depending on manufacturing technology. However, any increase or decrease of volume is small compared to the total volume of the element.The part\u2013whole relationship is established by an aggregation relationship object, expressing the decomposition of an element type into one or more additive elements (element parts) and zero or more feature elements.HISTORY  New entity in IFC4.*Containment Use Definition*:Surface features shall have no spatial containment relationship to the spatial structure since they are dependent on element types without spatial containment relationships or on an element occurrence with own spatial containment relationship.The SELF\\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure relationship shall be NIL.*Geometry use definition*:The geometric representation of IfcSurfaceFeatureElement is given by the IfcProductDefinitionShape, allowing multiple geometric representation.Local PlacementThe local placement for IfcSurfaceFeatureElement is defined in its supertype IfcProduct. It is defined by the IfcLocalPlacement, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.In case of features which are part of an element type, absolute placement into the type object's implied coordinate system shall be used.\nIn case of features which are voiding an element occurrence, the PlacementRelTo relationship of IfcLocalPlacement shall point to the local placement of the respective element.Shape representationDifferent shape representations may be used, depending on the nature of the feature and information requirements:Symbolic representation, such as the two-dimensional bounding box of a tag.\nA geometric set representing the geometric items of a mark.\nSurface representations of treated parts of the lement surface by means of IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel. The faces within the surface model may be included into a B-Rep model within a representation map of the parent element type.Higher-level parameters (geometric and non-geometric) may be provided by property sets based on local agreements.",
