The Object Placement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an Ifc Product Definition Shape being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items).Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AECFM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype Ifc Element) and spatial items (covered by the subtype Ifc Spatial Element) the Ifc Product also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.Any instance of Ifc Product defines a particular occurrence of a product. The common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of Ifc Product, is handled by the Ifc Type Product (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of Ifc Product by using the objectified relationship Ifc Rel Defines By Type. The Ifc Type Product may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.",

However the definition of Ifc Plate is material independent and specific material information shall be handled by using Ifc Rel Associates Material to assign a material specification to the Ifc Plate.Plates are often add-on parts. This is represented by the Ifc Rel Aggregates decomposition mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as Ifc Plate, into a container element such as Ifc Element Assembly or Ifc Curtain Wall.An instance of Ifc Plate should preferably get its geometric representation and material assignment through the type definition by Ifc Plate Type assigned using the Ifc Rel Defines By Type relationship. This allows identical plates in a construction to be represented by the same instance of Ifc Plate Type.A plate may have openings, such as voids or recesses. They are defined by an Ifc Opening Element attached to the plate using the inverse relationship Has Openings pointing to Ifc Rel Voids Element. The position number of a plate as often used in steel construction is assigned through the attribute Ifc Element.Tag There are two main representations for plate occurrencesIfc Plate with Ifc Material Layer Set Usage is used for all occurrences of plates, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the Ifc Material Layer Set Usage. These plates are always represented geometrically by a Swept Solid geometry (or by a Clipping geometry based on Swept Solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.",

Such a feature may be manufactured in different ways, for example by cutting, drilling, or milling of members made of various materials, or by inlays into the formwork of cast members made of materials such as concrete.The standard use of instances of Ifc Voiding Feature is as a part of element type objects (instances of subtypes of Ifc Element Type). The partwhole relationship is established by an aggregation relationship object, expressing the decomposition of an element type into one or more additive elements (element parts) and zero or more feature elements.",
