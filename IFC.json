        "Description": "_IfcConstructionResource_ is an abstract generalization of the different resources used in construction projects, mainly labour, material, equipment and product resources, plus subcontracted resources and aggregations such as a crew resource.\n\nA resource represents \"use of something\" and does not necessarily correspond to a single item such as a person or vehicle, but represents a pool of items having limited availability such as general labor or an equipment fleet. A resource can represent either a generic resource pool (not having any task assignment) or a task-specific resource allocation (having an _IfcTask_ assignment).\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x2.\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Modified in to promote _ResourceIdentifer_ and _ResourceGroup_ (renamed to _LongDescription_) to supertype _IfcResource_ and add attributes as described.\n\n{ .use-head}\nDeclaration use definition\n\nA root-level resource (specifically _IfcCrewResource_ or _IfcSubContractResource_) is declared within the project by _IfcRelDeclares_ where _RelatingContext_ refers to the single _IfcProject_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_, and other root-level objects within the project.\n\n{ .use-head}\nAssignment use definition\n\nA resource may be assigned to an actor by _IfcRelAssignsToActor_ where _RelatingActor_ refers to an _IfcActor_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Such relationship indicates the actor responsible for allocating the resource such as partitioning into task-specific allocations, delegating to other actors, and/or scheduling over time. Note that this assignment does not indicate the person or organization performing the work; that is indicated by _IfcRelAssignsToResource_. The actor responsible for the resource may or may not be the same as any actor(s) performing work.\n\nA resource may be assigned to a control by _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ where _RelatingProduct_ refers to an _IfcControl_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcWorkCalendar_ is assigned indicating availability of the resource, where such calendar is nested within a base calendar or an _IfcWorkPlan_ which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.\n\nA resource may be assigned to a group by _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ where _RelatingGroup_ refers to an _IfcGroup_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcAsset_ is assigned indicating the asset to be tracked, where such asset is nested within an _IfcInventory_ which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.\n\nA resource may be assigned to a product by _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ where _RelatingProduct_ refers to an _IfcProduct_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcElement_ subtype is assigned indicating the product to be constructed, where such product is connected to a spatial structure which in turn is aggregated within the _IfcProject_.\n\nA resource may be assigned to a process by _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ where _RelatingProcess_ refers to an _IfcProcess_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcTask_ is assigned indicating the task to be performed by the resource, where such task is nested within a summary task which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.\n\nA resource may have assignments of other objects using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ where _RelatingResource_ refers to the _IfcConstructionResource_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more objects such as _IfcActor_ or _IfcProduct_ subtypes. This relationship indicates specific objects assigned to fulfill resource usage.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates resource assignment.\n\n![\"Assignment Use Definition\"](../../../../figures/ifcconstructionresource-assignment.png \"Figure 1 &mdash; Construction resource assignment use\")\n\n{ .use-head}\nBaseline use definition\n\nA resource may have any number of baselines defined using the relationship _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ where _RelatingObject_ is the \"current\" resource and _RelatedObjects_ consists of multiple \"baseline\" resources, each representing a copy of the resource as it existed at an earlier point in time as shown in Figure 185. Each baseline _IfcConstructionResource_ is identified by its nested _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship to an _IfcWorkSchedule_ having _PredefinedType=BASELINE_, _IfcWorkSchedule.CreationDate_ indicating the date of the baseline, and _IfcWorkSchedule.Name_ indicating the name of the baseline.\n\n![\"Baseline Use Definition\"](../../../../figures/ifcconstructionresource-baseline.png \"Figure 2 &mdash; Construction resource baseline use\")\n",

The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional   (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz)."

Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.\n\nIn addition to physical products (covered by the subtype _IfcElement_) and spatial items (covered by the subtype _IfcSpatialElement_) the _IfcProduct_ also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.\n\nAny instance of _IfcProduct_ defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of _IfcProduct_, is handled by the _IfcTypeProduct_ (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of _IfcProduct_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_.

The project establishes the context for information to be exchanged or shared, and it may represent a construction project but does not have to. The _IfcProject_'s main purpose in an exchange structure is to provide the root instance and the context for all other information items included.\n\nThe context provided by the _IfcProject_ includes:\n\n* the default units\n* the geometric representation context for exchange structures including shape representations \n    * the project coordinate system\n    * the coordinate space dimension\n    * the precision used within the geometric representations\n    * optionally the indication of the true north\n    * optionally the map conversion between the project coordinate system and the geospatial coordinate reference system. \n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The attributes _RepresentationContexts_ and _UnitsInContext_ are made optional and are promoted to supertype _IfcContext_.\n\n{ .spec-head}\nInformal Propositions:\n\n1. There shall only be one project within the exchange context. This is enforced by the global rule _IfcSingleProjectInstance_.\n\n## Formal Propositions\n\n### HasName\nThe _Name_ attribute has to be provided for _IfcProject_. It is the short name for the project.\n\n### CorrectContext\nIf a _RepresentationContexts_ relation is provided then there shall be no instance of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ directly included in the set of _RepresentationContexts_.\n\n### NoDecomposition\nThe _IfcProject_ represents the root of the any decomposition tree. It shall therefore not be used to decompose any other object definition.\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Project Classification Information\n\n\n### Project Declaration\n\nThe IfcProject is also the context for other information about the construction project such as a work plan. Non-product structures are assigned by their first level object to IfcProject using the IfcRelDeclares relationship. The IfcProject provides the context for work plans (or other non-product based) descriptions of the construction project. It is handled by the objectified relationship IfcRelDeclares.\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The spatial structure and the schedule structure can be decomposed. For example the IfcBuilding can be decomposed into IfcBuildingStorey's, and the IfcWorkPlan can be decomposed into IfcWorkSchedule's.\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The products and tasks can be decomposed further. For example the IfcCurtainWall can be decomposed into IfcMember and IfcPlate, the IfcTask can be decomposed into other IfcTask's.\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The products and tasks can have direct linking relationships. For example the IfcCurtainWall can be assigned to a IfcTask as an input or output for a construction schedule.\n\n\nFigure 128 illustrates the use of IfcProject as context for work plans or work schedules.\n\n\n![project relationships](../../../../figuresifcproject_fig-1.png)\nFigure 128 \u2014 Project spatial and work plan structure\n\n\n\n### Project Document Information\n\n\n### Project Global Positioning\n\nThe representation context of the project refers to a global positioning, i.e. the local engineering coordinate system of the project has a mapping to a defined projected coordinate system (a rectangular map coordinate system, as used in GIS systems)\n\n\n### Project Library Information\n\n\n### Project Representation Context\n\n\n### Project Units\n\n\n### Spatial Decomposition\n\nThe IfcProject is used to reference the root of the spatial structure of a building or other construction project (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together, and to the IfcProject, by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates. \n\n\nThe following constraints are applied to using the relationshio IfcRelAggregates in context of IfcProject\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The anomaly to use the composition structure through IfcRelAggregates for assigning the uppermost spatial container to IfcProject is due to upward compatibility reasons with earlier releases of this standard.\n\n\n* IfcProject.Decomposes -- it shall be NIL, i.e. the IfcProject shall be on top of the root of the spatial structure tree.\n* IfcProject.IsDecomposedBy -- referencing (IfcSite || IfcBuilding || IfcSpatialZone) by using IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects. The IfcSite, IfcBuilding, or IfcSpatialZone being referenced shall be the root of the spatial structure.\n\n\nFigure 129 illustrates project relationships with spatial structures, elements, and element type libraries.\n\n\n![spatial decomposition relationships](../../../../figuresifcproject_fig-2.png)\nFigure 129 \u2014 Project spatial structure, products and product type library",

First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of _IfcResource_, or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn't have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of _IfcResource_ (or its subtypes) alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project.\n\n> EXAMPLE&nbsp; construction equipment such as earth-moving vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of _IfcResource_ alone.\n\nSecond, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of _IfcResource_ objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the _IfcResource_ instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced. Things that might be used as resources and that are already modeled in the IFC include physical products, people and organizations, and materials.

        "Parent": "IfcLinearPositioningElement",
        "Description": "For the purposes of IFC the English term \"alignment\" defines three essentially separate but closely interconnected concepts.\n\n1. defintion of a reference system for linear positioning\n2. safeguarding and optimization of the movement of vehicles - kinematic perspective\n3. geometric construction of roads, railway tracks or other linear infrastructure\n\n**Reference system for linear positioning**\n\nAn alignment is used to define a reference system to position elements mainly for linear construction works, such as roads, rails, bridges, and others. The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology.  \n\n> NOTE&nbsp; See ISO 19148 Geographic information &ndash; Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing.  \n\n**Kinematic perspective**\n\nIn the kinematic perspective focus is on the safe and optimized movement of a vehicle under the constraints induced by changes in the direction of the horizontal and the vertical layout.\n\n**Geometric perspective**\n\nIn the geometric perspective the focus is on the proper placement of horizontal and vertical segments to connect certain points along a proposed path. A huge body of knowledge has been developed over a long period of time, in many aspects predating the availability of modern computers and their software.\n\n\n\n**State of the art in contemporary engineering**\n\n1. Contemporary engineering usually establishes first a horizontal layout in a properly projected plane.\n\n2. In a second step the vertical profile (i.e. sequence of segments with constant gradients  together with smoothing segments showing a variation in gradient) is added.\n\n3. In the rail domain in most cases a cant layout is added to the horizontal layout to compensate a part of the unwanted lateral acceleration.\n\n4. In a final step the proposed layout is checked against a defined set of rules, formulas and thresholds to guarantee the conformance against the regulation.\n\nThe sequence of steps might change from case to case and might be repeated one or more times to achieve the economic objectives and fulfill regulatory safety requirements. \n\n\nContemporary alignment design almost always implements a 2.5 dimension approach. \n\nThe resulting and documented geometry might be very precise or just good enough to meet safety thresholds. This depends on factors like priorities of the management, date of the design - existing alignments might have been designed more then 50 years ago - or software tools used. Working with legacy data in a high precision BIM model requires a good understanding of these factors.\n\n**Distinction between business modeling and IFC core geometry**\n\nAccording to IFC modeling principles alignment entities are organised in two large parts. The two parts work together, but they can also be used independently from each other\n\n1. Business aspects of alignment\n2. Representation with the IFC geometry resources\n\n**Business aspects of alignment:** Here the focus is a on a schema structure as close to business terminology as possible. It is possible to have a very detailed segment structure with many domain specific properties attached. Examples for domain specific properties are design speed or cant deficiency.\n\n**Representation with IFC geometry resources:** Here the focus is on using as much of the established IFC geometry entities as possible. A mapping between Business aspects and IFC geometry is proposed.\n\n**IFC modelling**\n\nIn IFC a single alignment must have:  \n\n* a horizontal alignment defined in the x/y plane of the engineering coordinate system  \n\nA single alignment may have: \n\n* an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along / z coordinate space  \n* a relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and/or at constant or variable offsets  \n* a 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data.  \n\nAlignments may be aggregated into referents (_IfcReferent_) or derivative alignments. Derivative alignments may be used to indicate dependent alignments, such as an alignment for a bridge that is relative to a parent alignment for a road, where the child _IfcAlignment_ may have its shape representation set to _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ that starts and ends at a span within the extent of the shape representation of the parent _IfcAlignment_.  \n\nAlignments may be assigned to groups using _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_, where _IfcGroup_ or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments.  \n\nSupported shape representations of <span class=\"self-ref\">IfcAlignment</span> are:  \n\n* _IfcGradientCurve_ as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment (represented by their alignment segments)  \n* _IfcCompositeCurve_ as a 2D horizontal alignment (represented by its horizontal alignment segments) without a vertical alignment  \n* _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcAlignmentCurve_ or another _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_  \n* _IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve_ as a 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcGradientCurve_ to incorporate the application of cant \n* _IfcPolyline_ as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation (such as coming from a survey)  \n* _IfcPolyline_ as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation (such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation)  \n\nThe _RepresentationIdentifier_ shall always be set to 'Axis' and the _RepresentationType_ shall be set to either 'Curve2D' or 'Curve3D' depending on if the referenced curve is 2- or 3-dimensional\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Derivative specifications (Model View Definitions) may expand the above set to include additional supported curve types.\n"

The first value is the distance along the horizontal alignment, and the second value is the height relative to the projection of the point along vertical alignment.\n\n\n**Cant as a railway specificity**\n\n![\"Why cant is applied\"](../../figures/ifcalignmentcant_wojtczak_2018.png \"Figure 1 &mdash; Cant - compensation for lateral acceleration.\")\n\n&gt;NOTE figure was first published in (Basics of) Railway Curve Kinematics Presentation, (Wojtczak 2018)\n\nThe diagram in the figure above shows the principle of compensating part of the lateral acceleration by elevating the outer rail relative to the inner rail of a track.\n\nAlmost always the following principles for the placement of horizontal segments and cant segments are implemented:\n* Straight horizontal line: no applied cant\n* Horizontal circular arc: constant applied cant\n* Horizontal transition bend: variation of applied cant according to a defined formula\n\nIn specific difficult topographic environments like mountain lines the extension of a cant transition may differ from the horizontal transition. So far this has only been found for clothoids and is either a so called shortened ramp (can transition is shorter than the corresponding horizontal curvature transition) or a so called \u201cscissor\u201d ramp (overlapping variations of cant on both rails with opposite direction). \n\nApplication of high-performance horizontal transition bends is always combined with a cant transition with identical start and end location.\n\nIn real world designs, such as slow speed sections in railway stations, exceptions to the above principles can be found. It might even happen that the inner rail is elevated relative to the outer rail.\n\nDetailed geometric modelling of the superelevation has a low priority in the existing processes in most rail companies. This will very probably change with the introduction of 3D modelling in rail design. The following list shows some use cases:\n\n* Correct 3D placement of certain assets (e.g. sleepers)\n* Relevant input for calculation of structural gauge space\n* Correct calculation of horizontal coordinate values for the Viennese Bend\u00ae (high performance transition bend)\n\n\n\n![\"Cant and structural gauge space\"](../../figures/ifcalignmentcant_structural_gauge_and_cant.png \"Figure 2 &mdash; Cant and structural gauge space\")\n",

Only those presentation information, that cannot be directly related to a single product, have to be wrapped within the _IfcAnnotation_.\n\nIf available, the annotation should be related to the spatial context of the project, by containing the annotation within the appropriate level of the building structure (site, facility, facility part or building, storey, or space).

Elements either remain permanently in the AEC product, or only temporarily, as formwork does. Elements can be either assembled on site or pre-manufactured and built in on site.\n\n> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Examples of elements in a building construction context are walls, floors, windows and recesses.\n\nThe elements can be logically contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a certain level within a project structure hierarchy (site, building, storey or space). This is done by using the _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ and _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ relationship.\n\nIn addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type (and thereby be defined by the element type properties) using the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship. An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the AEC product. Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.\n\n> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair, composed by Flights and Landings.\n\nElements that performs the same function may be grouped by an \"Element Group By Function\". It is realized by an instance of _IfcGroup_ with the _ObjectType_ ='ElementGroupByFunction'.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0\n",

The _IfcTransportElement_ defines the occurrence of a transport element, that (if given), is expressed by the _IfcTransportElementType_.\n\n> EXAMPLE Transportation elements include elevator (lift), escalator, moving walkway, etc.  \n\n> NOTE&nbsp; More detailed equipment that may be a part of a transportation device, like a lifting hook, is defined as _IfcDiscreteAccessory_. It maybe included as a part of the _IfcTransportElement_ by virtue of the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.  \n\nTransport element can describe fixed or non fixed elements, which can either be identified as specified operational assets within a facility or vehicles that interact with the facility as a user or customer. \nIn the case of operational assets, instances of _IfcTransportElement_ can represent individual identifiable vehicles or structures with properties such as serial numbers, registration numbers etc. and be typed accordingly by instances of _IfcTransportElementType_.  \n\nIn the case transport elements that interact as users or customers, such as cars on a road or vessels at a port, _IfcTransportElementType_ is used to define element specifications which are used to design, analyse and provide operational constraints to the facility. \n\nDepending on local classification systems transport elements and transportation systems in buildings are either considered as part of a built system, or as part of a built service system. Within IFC they are considered as part of a built system and may have to be mapped appropriately.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x.\n\n{ .change-ifc2x}\n> IFC2x CHANGE&nbsp; The attribute _PredefinedType_ (previously OperationType) is made optional.\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The last attributes CapacityByWeight and CapacityByNumber are removed, use Pset_TransportElementCommon instead.\n",

        "Description": "_IfcProfileDef_ is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry.\n\n* Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters.\n* Arbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries.\n* Derived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available.\n* In addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef.\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Changed from ABSTRACT to non-abstract for uses which do not require an explicitly defined geometry. Added inverse attributes _HasProperties_ and _HasExternalReference_.\n\n**Use in material association**\n\nBeams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition, by means of _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ together with _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ and _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. This way, building elements and element types with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and association.\n\nThe profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with shape representations of the respective building elements.\n\nA higher-level description of spatial aligment of the section profile of a member (such as centered, bottom-left, in the geometric centroid, and more) can be provided within _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ by means of a cardinal point reference. This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent.\n\n**Use in shape models**\n\nProfile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or sectioned spines.\n\nThe purpose of the profile definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define a uniform cross section being swept:\n\n* along a line (extrusion) using _IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion_ or _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_\n* along a circular arc (revolution) using _IfcSurfaceOfRevolution_ or _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_\n* along a directrix lying on a reference surface using _IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid_\n\nThe purpose of the profile definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype _IfcDerivedProfileDef_ is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the identity of vertices and edges.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Subtypes of the _IfcProfileDef_ contain parameterized profiles (as subtypes of _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_) which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given by explicit curve geometry (either open or closed profiles) and two special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a 2D Cartesian transformation.\n\nAn _IfcProfileDef_ is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The attribute _ProfileType_ is set to AREA. An _IfcProfileDef_ is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this case, the inside of the profile (if the curve is closed) is not part of the profile. The attribute _ProfileType_ is set to CURVE.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates use of parameterized profiles within a swept area solid.\n\n<table><tr><td>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" frame=\"border\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\n      <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" width=\"420\">\n\n<img src=\"../../../../figures/ifcprofiledef-layout1.gif\" alt=\"Example of standard profile definition\" border=\"0\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\">\n\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n\n<p><u>Position</u><br>\nThe <em>IfcProfileDef</em> is defined within the underlying\ncoordinate system which is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid\nthat uses the profile definition.

This inverse relationship is used to associate an _IfcExternalReference_ (notably _IfcClassificationReference_ or _IfcLibraryReference_) with the profile.\n\n_IfcClassificationReference_ is used to refer to a profile norm (a common standard or manufacturer's standard). In this case,\n\n* _IfcClassificationReference.ItemReference_ contains the formal profile designation from the norm. (On the other hand, _IfcProfileDef.ProfileName_ contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)\n* _IfcClassificationReference.Name_ carries the short name of the profile norm.\n* Optionally, the norm can be further described by _IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource_.\n\n_IfcLibraryReference_ is used to refer to a library which contains profile definitions. In this case,\n\n* _IfcLibraryReference.ItemReference_ contains the identifier of the profile within the library and is meant to be machine-readable (in contrast to _IfcProfileDef.ProfileName_ which should be human-readable).\n* _IfcLibraryReference.Location_ and ._Name_ or ._ReferencedLibrary_ further describe the library.\n\nIf an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the referenced classification or library.\n\n**Direct instances of _IfcProfileDef_**\n\nUsually, only subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ should be instantiated. In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes other than geometric models (e.g. for structural analysis models), it may be possible to directly instantiate _IfcProfileDef_ and further specify the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter are tracked by the inverse attribute _HasProperties_.\n",

It is not required to be load bearing.\n\n{ .extDef}\n> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1: structural member for carrying load(s) between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; The representation of load-bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of _IfcStructuralMember_ (with _IfcStructuralCurveMember_ being mostly applicable) as part of an _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity _IfcMember_ should be used.\n\nThe camber of a beam may be defined by assigning a StructuralCurveMember with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction.\n\nThere are two entities for beam occurrences:\n\n* _IfcBeamStandardCase_ used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. These beams are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ assigned. \n>> NOTE&nbsp; Model view definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, for example, by excluding tapering from an _IfcBeamStandardCase_ implementation.* _IfcBeam_ used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non-uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only 'AdvancedBrep', 'Brep', 'SurfaceModel', or 'Tessellation' geometry. \n>> NOTE&nbsp; Model view definitions and implementer agreements may impose the use of _IfcBeam_ in all cases by excluding _IfcBeamStandardCase_ from scope of the model view.\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0\n",

The same agreements to the special types of plates, as defined in the _PredefinedType_ attribute apply as well.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC4.\n\n## Formal Propositions\n\n### HasMaterialLayerSetUsage\nA valid instance of _IfcPlateStandardCase_ relies on the provision of an _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_.\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Body Clipping Geometry\n\nThe following constraints apply to the 'Clipping'\nrepresentation:\n\n\n* Solid: see 'SweptSolid' shape representation,\n* Profile:\u00a0see 'SweptSolid' shape\nrepresentation,\n* Extrusion:\u00a0see 'SweptSolid' shape\nrepresentation,\n* Material:\u00a0see 'SweptSolid' shape\nrepresentation,\n* Boolean result: The IfcBooleanClippingResult\nshall be supported, allowing for Boolean differences between the\nswept solid (here IfcExtrudedAreaSolid) and one or several\nIfcHalfSpaceSolid.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n![advanced plate](../../../../figuresifcslab_advanced-layout1.gif)\n\n> EXAMPLE\u00a0 Figure 252 illustrates a 'Clipping' geometric representation with definition of a plate using advanced geometric representation. The profile is extruded non-perpendicular and the plate body is clipped at the eave.\n\n\nFigure 252 \u2014 Plate body clipping\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n### Body SweptSolid Geometry\n\nThe following additional constraints apply to the swept solid\nrepresentation:\n\n\n* Solid: IfcExtrudedAreaSolid is required,\n* Profile: IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef,\nIfcRectangleProfileDef, IfcRoundedRectangleProfileDef,\nIfcCircleProfileDef, IfcEllipseProfileDef shall be\nsupported.\n* Extrusion: The profile can be extruded perpendicularly\nor non-perpendicularly to the plane of the swept profile.\n* Material: The definition of the\nIfcMaterialLayerSetUsage, particularly of the\nOffsetFromReferenceLine and the\nForLayerSet.TotalThickness, has to be consistent to the\n'SweptSolid' representation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n![standard plate](../../../../figuresifcslab_standard-layout1.gif)\n\n> EXAMPLE\u00a0 Figure 251 illustrates a 'SweptSolid' geometric representation.

It is\naccessible by the inverse HasAssociations relationship.\nMulti-layer plates can be represented by refering to several\nIfcMaterialLayer's within the IfcMaterialLayerSet\nthat is referenced from the\nIfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.\u00a0\n\n\nMaterial information can also be given at the\nIfcPlateType, defining the common attribute data for all\noccurrences of the same type.\u00a0It is then accessible by the\ninverse IsDefinedBy relationship pointing to\nIfcPlateType.HasAssociations and via\nIfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial.\n\n\nThe IfcPlateStandardCase defines in addition that the\nIfcPlateType should have a unique\nIfcMaterialLayerSet, that is referenced by\nthe\u00a0IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage assigned to all\noccurrences of this IfcPlateType.\n\n\nFigure 250 illustrates assignment of IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage and IfcMaterialLayerSet to the IfcPlateStandardCase as the plate occurrence and to the IfcPlateType.

The IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine is given as a distance from this plane.\n* The IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.DirectionSense defines how the IfcMaterialLayer's are assigned to the reference plane. POSITIVE means in direction to the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.\n* The IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine is the distance parallel to the reference plane and always perpendicular to the base (XY) plane of the reference coordinate system. This is independent of a potential non-perpendicular extrusion given by IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection <> 0.,0.,1. A positive value of IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine would then point into the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.\n* The Thickness of each IfcMaterialLayer shall be the parallel distance (measured perpendicular to the base plane). The TotalThickness of the IfcMaterialLayerSet is the sum of all layer thicknesses and in case of a perpendicular extrusion identical with IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Depth\n* The IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.LayerSetDirection i always AXIS3.\n\n\n![plate material layer set](../../../../figuresifcmateriallayersetusage_slab-01.png)\nFigure 251 \u2014 Plate material layers\n\n\n\n### Product Placement\n\nThe following restriction is imposed:\n\n\n* The local placement shall provide the location and directions \nfor the standard plate, the x/y plane is the plane for the \nprofile, and the z-axis is the extrusion axis for the plate body."

These slabs are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ assigned.\n* _IfcSlabElementedCase_ used for occurrences of slabs which are aggregated from subordinate elements, following specific decomposition rules expressed by the mandatory use of _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.\n* _IfcSlab_ used for all other occurrences of slabs, particularly for slabs with changing thickness, or slabs with non planar surfaces, and slabs having only 'SweptSolid' or 'Brep' geometry.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0; it is a merger of the two previous entities IfcFloor, IfcRoofSlab, introduced in IFC1.0\n",

There must be an object corresponding to each type of part, however there may be single object instance indicating multiple placements (via mapping geometry) for each part, or multiple instances corresponding to each placement. For minimizing file size, it is recommended to use a single object with multiple placement unless there are specific connectivity relationships indicated (e.g. a junction box connected to a specific stud).\n\n\n\n\n### Element Voiding\n\nAs shown in Figure 285, openings within the composite wall are directly assigned to IfcWallElementedCase using IfcRelVoidsElement pointing to IfcOpeningElement and apply to all aggregated parts. If individual parts have cutting and other voiding features, then the decomposed parts have a separate voiding relationship IfcRelVoidsElement pointing to IfcVoidingFeature.\n\n\n![voiding](../../../../figuresifcwallelementedcase_fig01.png)\nFigure 285 \u2014 Wall elemented voiding\n\n\n\n### Product Local Placement\n\nThe use of local placement is defined at the supertype\nIfcWall.

These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows:\n\n* Impart control over flow control elements (_IfcFlowController_) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (_IfcActuator_).\n* Sensing elements (_IfcSensor_) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.\n* Controllers (_IfcController_) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.\n\nSince _IfcDistributionControlElement_ and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (_IfcDistributionFlowElement_), the objectified relationship _IfcRelFlowControlElements_ has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.\n\nThe key distinction between _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ and _IfcDistributionControlElement_ is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between _IfcFlowMeter_ (subtype of _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ measuring a flow quantity) and _IfcFlowInstrument_ (subtype of _IfcDistributionControlElement_ measuring a flow quality), is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures (having inlet/outlet pipes for the measured substance) follows the _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ hierarchy (and therefore _IfcFlowMeter_ which measures the flow internally). Otherwise, if it monitors/controls but does not connect inline within the flow system (it is external or is a component of another device), then it follows the _IfcDistributionControlElement_ hierarchy (and therefore _IfcFlowInstrument_ which may display various attributes through connected sensors).\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0.\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Attribute _ControlElementId_ attribute deleted; replaced by classification usage.

        "Description": "An element component is a representation for minor items included in, added to or connecting to or between elements, which usually are not of interest from the overall building structure viewpoint. However, these small parts may have vital and load carrying functions within the construction. These items do not provide any actual space boundaries. Typical examples of _IfcElementComponent_s include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories.\n\nOne or several instances of subtypes of _IfcElementComponent_ should always be accompanied by a defining instance of a respective subtype of _IfcElementComponentType_. The type object holds shape and material information.\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x2\n\nIt is often desirable to model a number of same-shaped element components by means of a single occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements. In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below.\n\nTo express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level, a _Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities_ should be provided via _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ and contain the number of pieces which are placed by a single _IfcElementComponent_ instance.\n\n{ .use-head}\n**Symbolic Representation**\n\nA symbolic representation is defined for a row of components or several rows of components within a single instance of _IfcElementComponent_. Such rows or arrays may contain possibly large numbers of individual pieces. The product definition shape consists of an _IfcShapeRepresentation_ with the attribute values\n\n* _RepresentationIdentifier_ : 'Row'\n* _RepresentationType_ : 'GeometricCurveSet'\n\nand one or several curves as geometric items. The curves represent where reference points of the pieces are located. For example, such reference points may be at the heads of mechanical fasteners or at the starting point of the extrusion axis of reinforcement bars. In case of straight components (bolts, nails, staples, straight reinforcement bars, or similar), the local placement of the _IfcElementComponent_ shall be located and oriented such that the local z axis is parallel with the axes of the components. A _Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities_ should denote the count of pieces in the row or array and their spacing.\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Mapped Geometry\n\nThe mapped item, IfcMappedItem, should be used if appropriate as it allows for reusing the geometry definition of a type at all occurrences of the same type.\n\n\nA single instance of a subtype of IfcElementComponent can stand for several \nactual element components at once. In this case, the IfcShapeRepresentation\ncontains as many mapped items as there are element components combined within this\n occurrence object.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n![](../../../../figuresifcelementcomponent_multiple.png)\n\n> EXAMPLE\u00a0 Figure 304 illustrates multiple components modeled as a single occurrence object (here: IfcFastener)\n\n\nFigure 304 \u2014 Element component mapped representation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRepresentation identifier and type are the same as in single mapped representation.\nThe number of mapped items in the representation corresponds with the count of\nelement components in the IfcElementQuantity.\n\n\n\n### Property Sets for Objects",
