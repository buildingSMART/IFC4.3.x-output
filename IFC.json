The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load.

A context is a specific kind of object definition as it provides the project or library context in which object types and object occurrences are defined.Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are five essential kinds of relationships in which object definitions (by their instantiable subtypes) can be involved: Assignment of other objects - an assignment relationship (IfcRelAssigns) that refers to other types of objects and creates a bi-directional association. The semantic of the assignment is established at the level of the subtypes of the general IfcRelAssigns relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment.; Association to external resources - an association relationship (IfcRelAssociates) that refers to external sources of information (most notably a classification or document) and creates a uni-directional association. There is no dependency implied by the association.; Aggregation of other objects - an aggregation relationship (IfcRelAggregates) that establishes an unordered, spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.; Nesting of other objects - a nesting relationship (IfcRelNests) that establishes an ordered, non-spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.; Declaration within a context - a relationship (IfcRelDeclares) of the uppermost object definition within the object definition tree (e.g. the summary object within an object nesting tree) to the context (a project or project library).

An IfcProduct occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an IfcProductDefinitionShape being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items).Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype IfcElement) and spatial items (covered by the subtype IfcSpatialElement) the IfcProduct also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.Any instance of IfcProduct defines a particular occurrence of a product. The common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of IfcProduct, is handled by the IfcTypeProduct (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of IfcProduct by using the objectified relationship IfcRelDefinesByType. The IfcTypeProduct may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.",

The attribute PredefinedType should be used to capture the differences: an opening, where the thickness of the opening is greater or equal to the thickness of the element —; the attribute PredefinedType is set to OPENING; a recess or niche, where the thickness of the recess is smaller than the thickness of the element —; the attribute PredefinedType is set to RECESS for a recess or niche.If the value for PredefinedType is omitted, or the value is set to NOTDEFINED, no specific information of whether it is an opening or recess shall be assumed.An IfcOpeningElement has to be inserted into an IfcElement by using the IfcRelVoidsElement relationship. It may be filled by an IfcDoor, IfcWindow, or another filling element by using the relationship IfcRelFillsElement. Depending on the type of the IfcShapeRepresentation of the IfcOpeningElement the voiding relationship implies: if the IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier = 'Body', then the Body shape representation of the opening has to be subtracted from the body shape representation of the voided element - implicit Boolean difference operation.; if the IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier = 'Reference', then the Reference shape representation of the opening is not subtracted. It is provided in addition to the hole in the Body shape representation of the voided element.The IfcOpeningElement shall not participate in the containment relationship, i.e. it is not linked directly to the spatial structure of the project. It has a mandatory VoidsElements inverse relationship pointing to the IfcElement that is contained in the spatial structure. The inverse relationship ContainedInStructure shall be NIL.REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: void in a building element; ",

This would be the case in interference relationships where the RelatedElement creates a void in the RelatingElement dynamically.; ImpliedOrder=FALSE The RelatingElement and RelatedElement have no priority among each other. If the interference is to be resolved then no information about whether the InterferenceGeometry should be subtracted from the RelatingElement or the RelatedElement can be traced. This would be the case for clash detection results.; ImpliedOrder=UNKNOWN No information about the priorities is provided.The InterferenceType property optionally specifies the type of interference between the two elements, two set of default types are provided: Oriented interferences types imply usage of ImpliedOrder set to TRUE and specific choice of RelatingElement and RelatedElement to be meaningful: ; Crosses: the RelatingElement is crossing the RelatedElement (e.g. Railway crossing a road); PassesThrough: the RelatingElement is passing through the RelatedElement (e.g. a Road passing inside a tunnel); PassesOver: the RelatingElement is passing over the RelatedElement (e.g a bridge passing over a water canal); PassesUnder: the RelatingElement is passing under the RelatedElement (e.g a Tunnel passing under a road); ; ; Non oriented interferences types do not imply specific values of ImpliedOrder (but can still be set to detail shape interference calculation); Clash: The RelatingElement and RelatedElement have a spatial or shape-based clash; Along: The RelatingElement and RelatedElement have a common frontier/surface",

It is given as a one-to-one relationship, but allows each element (including virtual elements and openings) to define many such relationships and each space to be defined by many such relationships.Space boundaries are always defined as seen from the space. In general two basic types of space boundaries are distinguished: 1st level space boundary: defined as boundaries of the space, not taking into account any change in building element or spaces on the other side.; 2nd level space boundary: defined as boundary taking any change in building element or spaces on the other side into account. It can be further distinguished into; 2nd level type A: There is a space on the other side.; 2nd level type B: There is a building element on the other side.The exact definition of how space boundaries are broken down depends on the view definition, more detailed conventions on how space boundaries are decomposed can only be given at the domain or application type level.In an architectural or FM related view, a space boundary is defined totally from inside the space. This is a 1st level space boundary.; In a thermal view, the decomposition of the space boundary depends on the material of the providing building element and the adjacent spaces behind.

The spatial structure can be used to provide a spatial organization of a project.A spatial project structure might define as many levels of decomposition as necessary for the project. Elements within the spatial project structure are: site as IfcSite; ; facility as IfcFacility, or specifically; ; building as IfcBuilding; bridge as IfcBridge; marine facility as IfcMarineFacility; railway as IfcRailway; road as IfcRoad; ; ; ; facility part as IfcFacilityPart, or specifically; ; storey as IfcBuildingStorey; facility part as IfcFacilityPart; ; ; ; space as IfcSpaceor aggregations or parts thereof. The composition type declares an element to be either an element itself, or an aggregation (complex) or a decomposition (part). The interpretation of these types is given at each subtype of IfcSpatialStructureElement.The IfcRelAggregates is defined as an 1-to-many relationship and used to establish the relationship between exactly two levels within the spatial project structure. Finally the highest level of the spatial structure is assigned to IfcProject using the IfcRelAggregates.The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to other elements and systems by establishing the following relationships: Containment of elements : IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ContainsElements, used to assign any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. to the spatial structure element in which they are primarily contained.; Reference of elements : IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ReferencesElements, used to reference any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. in spatial structure elements, other then the one, where it is contained.; Reference of systems : IfcRelServicesBuildings by inverse attribute ServicedBySystems, used to reference a system, like a building service or electrical distribution system, a zonal system, or a structural analysis system, that is assigned to this spatial structure element.The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to each other by using the IfcRelAggregates relationship to build the project spatial structure. Figure 1 shows the use of IfcRelAggregates to establish a spatial structure including site, building, building section and storey. More information is provided at the level of the subtypes.Figure 1 — Spatial structure element composition",

Whether it is a structural load bearing element or a non-load bearing element is determined by the Pset_ColumnCommon.LoadBearing property.There are two main representations for column occurrences: IfcColumn with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all occurrences of columns, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might change uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. These columns are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.; IfcColumn is used for all other occurrences of columns, particularly for columns with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or columns defined by non-linear extrusion, or columns having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, if a more parametric representation is not intended.For any longitudial structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity IfcMember exists.REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1 structural member of slender form, usually vertical, that transmits to its base the forces, primarily in compression, that are applied to it.; ",

The location of the plate (being horizontal, vertical or sloped) is not relevant to its definition.Plates are normally made of steel, other metallic material, or by glass panels. However the definition of IfcPlate is material independent and specific material information shall be handled by using IfcRelAssociatesMaterial to assign a material specification to the IfcPlate.Plates are often add-on parts. This is represented by the IfcRelAggregates decomposition mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as IfcPlate, into a container element such as IfcElementAssembly or IfcCurtainWall.An instance of IfcPlate should preferably get its geometric representation and material assignment through the type definition by IfcPlateType assigned using the IfcRelDefinesByType relationship. This allows identical plates in a construction to be represented by the same instance of IfcPlateType.A plate may have openings, such as voids or recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the plate using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement. The position number of a plate as often used in steel construction is assigned through the attribute IfcElement.TagThere are two main representations for plate occurrences: IfcPlate with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all occurrences of plates, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage. These plates are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.; IfcPlate without IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of plates, particularly for plates with changing thickness, or plates with non planar surfaces, and plates having only 'SurfaceModel' or 'Brep' geometry or if a more parametric representation is not intended.REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: thin, rigid, flat, metal product, of a thickness greater than that of a sheet.; ",

These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows: Impart control over flow control elements (IfcFlowController) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (IfcActuator).; Sensing elements (IfcSensor) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.; Controllers (IfcController) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.Since IfcDistributionControlElement and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (IfcDistributionFlowElement), the objectified relationship IfcRelFlowControlElements has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.The key distinction between IfcDistributionFlowElement and IfcDistributionControlElement is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between IfcFlowMeter (subtype of IfcDistributionFlowElement measuring a flow quantity) and IfcFlowInstrument (subtype of IfcDistributionControlElement measuring a flow quality), is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures (having inlet/outlet pipes for the measured substance) follows the IfcDistributionFlowElement hierarchy (and therefore IfcFlowMeter which measures the flow internally). Otherwise, if it monitors/controls but does not connect inline within the flow system (it is external or is a component of another device), then it follows the IfcDistributionControlElement hierarchy (and therefore IfcFlowInstrument which may display various attributes through connected sensors).",

The quantities can be given as individual quantities, or those quantities are provided as element quantities by one or many building elements.
