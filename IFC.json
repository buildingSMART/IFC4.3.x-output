It can be used to identify the generic type of labour resource that is required for a purpose without having to be specific about the actor (person or organization) providing the resource occurrence. It may be particularly useful when creating an overall plan for a process or processes. For instance, within maintenance or work planning there may be a known task that needs to be done which is planned to require a 'chargehand pipe fitter'. There may be several such labour resources available and so the need to identify which will be used is not necessary at the planning stage.\n\n\n\nAt a later stage, individual actors can be determined for the labour resources. This is achieved through specifying the actor through _IfcActor_. The actor is then identified as the labour resource occurrence through the _IfcRelAssignsToResource.RelatedResource_ attribute.

The color temperatures of the commonest artificial light sources range from less than 3000K (warm white) to 4000K (intermediate) and over 5000K (daylight).\n"

Luminous flux is measured either for the interior as a whole or for a part of the interior (partial luminous flux for a solid angle). All other photometric parameters are derivatives of luminous flux. Luminous flux is measured in lumens (lm). The luminous flux is given as a nominal value for each lamp.\n"

Ballasts are needed to operate Discharge Lamps such as Fluorescent, Compact Fluorescent, High-pressure Mercury, Metal Halide and High-pressure Sodium Lamps. \n\nMagnetic ballasts are chokes which limit the current passing through a lamp connected in series on the principle of self-induction. The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional   (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz).\n"

Products are defined by their properties and representations.\n\n\n\nIn addition to physical products (covered by the subtype _IfcElement_) and spatial items (covered by the subtype _IfcSpatialElement_) the _IfcProduct_ also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.\n\n\n\nAny instance of _IfcProduct_ defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of _IfcProduct_, is handled by the _IfcTypeProduct_ (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of _IfcProduct_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_. The _IfcTypeProduct_ may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.\n\n\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; See _IfcTypeProduct_ for how to use a common geometric representation and _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for using and overriding common properties.\n\n\n\nOn a generic level products can be assigned to processes, controls, resources, project by using the relationship objects that refer to the corresponding object:\n\n\n\n* **Having a control applied**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcControl_\n\n* **Being assigned to a process**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcProcess_\n\n* **Being assigned to a resource**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcResource_\n\n\n\n> EXAMPLE&nbsp; An example of the control relationship is the assignment of a performance history to a distribution element. An example of process assignment relationship is the assignment of products like wall, slab, column to a contruction task for construction planning. And an example of resource assignment relationship is the assignment of products to a construction resource that consumes the product.\n\n\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0\n\n\n",

This is enforced by the global rule _IfcSingleProjectInstance_.\n\n\n\n## Formal Propositions\n\n\n\n### HasName\n\nThe _Name_ attribute has to be provided for _IfcProject_. It is the short name for the project.\n\n\n\n### CorrectContext\n\nIf a _RepresentationContexts_ relation is provided then there shall be no instance of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ directly included in the set of _RepresentationContexts_.\n\n\n\n### NoDecomposition\n\nThe _IfcProject_ represents the root of the any decomposition tree.

Non-product structures are assigned by their first level object to IfcProject using the IfcRelDeclares relationship. The IfcProject provides the context for work plans (or other non-product based) descriptions of the construction project. It is handled by the objectified relationship IfcRelDeclares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The spatial structure and the schedule structure can be decomposed. For example the IfcBuilding can be decomposed into IfcBuildingStorey's, and the IfcWorkPlan can be decomposed into IfcWorkSchedule's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The products and tasks can be decomposed further. For example the IfcCurtainWall can be decomposed into IfcMember and IfcPlate, the IfcTask can be decomposed into other IfcTask's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The products and tasks can have direct linking relationships. For example the IfcCurtainWall can be assigned to a IfcTask as an input or output for a construction schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 128 illustrates the use of IfcProject as context for work plans or work schedules.\n\n\n\n\n\n![project relationships](../../../../figuresifcproject_fig-1.png)\n\nFigure 128 \u2014 Project spatial and work plan structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Project Document Information\n\n\n\n\n\n### Project Global Positioning\n\n\n\nThe representation context of the project refers to a global positioning, i.e. the local engineering coordinate system of the project has a mapping to a defined projected coordinate system (a rectangular map coordinate system, as used in GIS systems)\n\n\n\n\n\n### Project Library Information\n\n\n\n\n\n### Project Representation Context\n\n\n\n\n\n### Project Units\n\n\n\n\n\n### Spatial Decomposition\n\n\n\nThe IfcProject is used to reference the root of the spatial structure of a building or other construction project (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together, and to the IfcProject, by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe following constraints are applied to using the relationshio IfcRelAggregates in context of IfcProject\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> NOTE\u00a0 The anomaly to use the composition structure through IfcRelAggregates for assigning the uppermost spatial container to IfcProject is due to upward compatibility reasons with earlier releases of this standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n* IfcProject.Decomposes -- it shall be NIL, i.e. the IfcProject shall be on top of the root of the spatial structure tree.\n\n* IfcProject.IsDecomposedBy -- referencing (IfcSite || IfcBuilding || IfcSpatialZone) by using IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects. The IfcSite, IfcBuilding, or IfcSpatialZone being referenced shall be the root of the spatial structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 129 illustrates project relationships with spatial structures, elements, and element type libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n![spatial decomposition relationships](../../../../figuresifcproject_fig-2.png)\n\nFigure 129 \u2014 Project spatial structure, products and product type library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of _IfcResource_, or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn't have to be instantiated in the system.

For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of _IfcResource_ alone.\n\n\n\nSecond, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of _IfcResource_ objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the _IfcResource_ instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced. Things that might be used as resources and that are already modeled in the IFC include physical products, people and organizations, and materials.

The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology.  \n\n\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; See ISO 19148 Geographic information &ndash; Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing.  \n\n\n\n**Kinematic perspective**\n\n\n\nIn the kinematic perspective focus is on the safe and optimized movement of a vehicle under the constraints induced by changes in the direction of the horizontal and the vertical layout.\n\n\n\n**Geometric perspective**\n\n\n\nIn the geometric perspective the focus is on the proper placement of horizontal and vertical segments to connect certain points along a proposed path. A huge body of knowledge has been developed over a long period of time, in many aspects predating the availability of modern computers and their software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**State of the art in contemporary engineering**\n\n\n\n1. Contemporary engineering usually establishes first a horizontal layout in a properly projected plane.\n\n\n\n2. In a second step the vertical profile (i.e. sequence of segments with constant gradients  together with smoothing segments showing a variation in gradient) is added.\n\n\n\n3. In the rail domain in most cases a cant layout is added to the horizontal layout to compensate a part of the unwanted lateral acceleration.\n\n\n\n4. In a final step the proposed layout is checked against a defined set of rules, formulas and thresholds to guarantee the conformance against the regulation.\n\n\n\nThe sequence of steps might change from case to case and might be repeated one or more times to achieve the economic objectives and fulfill regulatory safety requirements. \n\n\n\n\n\nContemporary alignment design almost always implements a 2.5 dimension approach. \n\n\n\nThe resulting and documented geometry might be very precise or just good enough to meet safety thresholds. This depends on factors like priorities of the management, date of the design - existing alignments might have been designed more then 50 years ago - or software tools used. Working with legacy data in a high precision BIM model requires a good understanding of these factors.\n\n\n\n**Distinction between business modeling and IFC core geometry**\n\n\n\nAccording to IFC modeling principles alignment entities are organised in two large parts. The two parts work together, but they can also be used independently from each other\n\n\n\n1. Business aspects of alignment\n\n2. Representation with the IFC geometry resources\n\n\n\n**Business aspects of alignment:** Here the focus is a on a schema structure as close to business terminology as possible. It is possible to have a very detailed segment structure with many domain specific properties attached. Examples for domain specific properties are design speed or cant deficiency.\n\n\n\n**Representation with IFC geometry resources:** Here the focus is on using as much of the established IFC geometry entities as possible. A mapping between Business aspects and IFC geometry is proposed.\n\n\n\n**IFC modelling**\n\n\n\nIn IFC a single alignment must have:  \n\n\n\n* a horizontal alignment defined in the x/y plane of the engineering coordinate system  \n\n\n\nA single alignment may have: \n\n\n\n* an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along / z coordinate space  \n\n* a relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and/or at constant or variable offsets  \n\n* a 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data.  \n\n\n\nAlignments may be aggregated into referents (_IfcReferent_) or derivative alignments. Derivative alignments may be used to indicate dependent alignments, such as an alignment for a bridge that is relative to a parent alignment for a road, where the child _IfcAlignment_ may have its shape representation set to _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ that starts and ends at a span within the extent of the shape representation of the parent _IfcAlignment_.  \n\n\n\nAlignments may be assigned to groups using _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_, where _IfcGroup_ or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments.  \n\n\n\nSupported shape representations of <span class=\"self-ref\">IfcAlignment</span> are:  \n\n\n\n* _IfcGradientCurve_ as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment (represented by their alignment segments)  \n\n* _IfcCompositeCurve_ as a 2D horizontal alignment (represented by its horizontal alignment segments) without a vertical alignment  \n\n* _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcAlignmentCurve_ or another _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_  \n\n* _IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve_ as a 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcGradientCurve_ to incorporate the application of cant \n\n* _IfcPolyline_ as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation (such as coming from a survey)  \n\n* _IfcPolyline_ as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation (such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation)  \n\n\n\nThe _RepresentationIdentifier_ shall always be set to 'Axis' and the _RepresentationType_ shall be set to either 'Curve2D' or 'Curve3D' depending on if the referenced curve is 2- or 3-dimensional\n\n\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Derivative specifications (Model View Definitions) may expand the above set to include additional supported curve types.\n\n\n"

The first value is the distance along the horizontal alignment, and the second value is the height relative to the projection of the point along vertical alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Cant as a railway specificity**\n\n\n\n![\"Why cant is applied\"](../../figures/ifcalignmentcant_wojtczak_2018.png \"Figure 1 &mdash; Cant - compensation for lateral acceleration.\")\n\n\n\n&gt;NOTE figure was first published in (Basics of) Railway Curve Kinematics Presentation, (Wojtczak 2018)\n\n\n\nThe diagram in the figure above shows the principle of compensating part of the lateral acceleration by elevating the outer rail relative to the inner rail of a track.\n\n\n\nAlmost always the following principles for the placement of horizontal segments and cant segments are implemented:\n\n* Straight horizontal line: no applied cant\n\n* Horizontal circular arc: constant applied cant\n\n* Horizontal transition bend: variation of applied cant according to a defined formula\n\n\n\nIn specific difficult topographic environments like mountain lines the extension of a cant transition may differ from the horizontal transition. So far this has only been found for clothoids and is either a so called shortened ramp (can transition is shorter than the corresponding horizontal curvature transition) or a so called \u201cscissor\u201d ramp (overlapping variations of cant on both rails with opposite direction). \n\n\n\nApplication of high-performance horizontal transition bends is always combined with a cant transition with identical start and end location.\n\n\n\nIn real world designs, such as slow speed sections in railway stations, exceptions to the above principles can be found. It might even happen that the inner rail is elevated relative to the outer rail.\n\n\n\nDetailed geometric modelling of the superelevation has a low priority in the existing processes in most rail companies. This will very probably change with the introduction of 3D modelling in rail design. The following list shows some use cases:\n\n\n\n* Correct 3D placement of certain assets (e.g. sleepers)\n\n* Relevant input for calculation of structural gauge space\n\n* Correct calculation of horizontal coordinate values for the Viennese Bend\u00ae (high performance transition bend)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![\"Cant and structural gauge space\"](../../figures/ifcalignmentcant_structural_gauge_and_cant.png \"Figure 2 &mdash; Cant and structural gauge space\")\n\n\n",

An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the AEC product. Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.\n\n\n\n> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair, composed by Flights and Landings.\n\n\n\nElements that performs the same function may be grouped by an \"Element Group By Function\". It is realized by an instance of _IfcGroup_ with the _ObjectType_ ='ElementGroupByFunction'.\n\n\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0\n\n\n",

A space may span over several connected spaces. Therefore a space group provides for a collection of spaces included in a storey. A space can also be decomposed in parts, where each part defines a partial space. This is defined by the _CompositionType_ attribute of the supertype _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ which is interpreted as follow:\n\n\n\n* COMPLEX = space group\n\n* ELEMENT = space\n\n* PARTIAL = partial space\n\n\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; View definitions and implementation agreements may restrict spaces with _CompositionType_=ELEMENT to be non-overlapping.\n\n\n\nThe _IfcSpace_ is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the _IfcSpace_ as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for space related elements.\n\n\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.\n\n\n\n![\"spatial structure\"](../../../../figures/ifcspace-spatialstructure.png \"Figure 1 &mdash; Space composition\")\n\n\n\nThe following guidelines should apply for using the _Name_, _Description_, _LongName_ and _ObjectType_ attributes.\n\n\n\n* _Name_ holds the unique name (or space number) from the plan.\n\n* _Description_ holds any additional information field the user may have specified, there are no further recommendations.\n\n* _LongName_ holds the full name of the space, it is often used in addition to the _Name_, if a number is assigned to the room, then the descriptive name is exchanged as _LongName_.\n\n* _ObjectType_ holds the space type, i.e. usually the functional category of the space .\n\n\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; In cases of inconsistency between the geometric representation of the _IfcSpace_ and the combined geometric representations of the surrounding _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_, the geometric representation of the space should take priority over the geometric representation of the surrounding space boundaries.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the _IfcSpace_.\n\n\n\n* elevation of the space (top of construction slab) equals elevation of storey: provided by _IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation_ relative to em>IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight\n\n* elevation of the space flooring (top of flooring on top of slab): provided by _IfcSpace.ElevationWithFlooring_ relative to _IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight_\n\n* height of space (top of slab below to bottom of slab above): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=\"Height\"\n\n* floor height of space (top of slab below to top of flooring): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=\"FinishFloorHeight\"\n\n* net height of space (top of flooring to bottom of suspended ceiling): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=\"FinishCeilingHeight\"\n\n\n\n![\"space heights\"](../../../../figures/ifcspace_heights.png \"Figure 2 &mdash; Space elevations\")\n\n\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0\n\n\n",

        "Description": "_IfcProfileDef_ is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry.\n\n\n\n* Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters.\n\n* Arbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries.\n\n* Derived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available.\n\n* In addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile.\n\n\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef.\n\n\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Changed from ABSTRACT to non-abstract for uses which do not require an explicitly defined geometry. Added inverse attributes _HasProperties_ and _HasExternalReference_.\n\n\n\n**Use in material association**\n\n\n\nBeams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition, by means of _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ together with _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ and _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. This way, building elements and element types with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and association.\n\n\n\nThe profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with shape representations of the respective building elements.\n\n\n\nA higher-level description of spatial aligment of the section profile of a member (such as centered, bottom-left, in the geometric centroid, and more) can be provided within _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ by means of a cardinal point reference. This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent.\n\n\n\n**Use in shape models**\n\n\n\nProfile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or sectioned spines.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the profile definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define a uniform cross section being swept:\n\n\n\n* along a line (extrusion) using _IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion_ or _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_\n\n* along a circular arc (revolution) using _IfcSurfaceOfRevolution_ or _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_\n\n* along a directrix lying on a reference surface using _IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid_\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the profile definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype _IfcDerivedProfileDef_ is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the identity of vertices and edges.\n\n\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Subtypes of the _IfcProfileDef_ contain parameterized profiles (as subtypes of _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_) which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given by explicit curve geometry (either open or closed profiles) and two special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a 2D Cartesian transformation.\n\n\n\nAn _IfcProfileDef_ is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The attribute _ProfileType_ is set to AREA. An _IfcProfileDef_ is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this case, the inside of the profile (if the curve is closed) is not part of the profile. The attribute _ProfileType_ is set to CURVE.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates use of parameterized profiles within a swept area solid.\n\n\n\n<table><tr><td>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" frame=\"border\" width=\"100%\">\n\n  <tbody>\n\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\n\n      <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" width=\"420\">\n\n\n\n<img src=\"../../../../figures/ifcprofiledef-layout1.gif\" alt=\"Example of standard profile definition\" border=\"0\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\">\n\n\n\n      </td>\n\n      <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n\n\n\n<p><u>Position</u><br>\n\nThe <em>IfcProfileDef</em> is defined within the underlying\n\ncoordinate system which is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid\n\nthat uses the profile definition.

This inverse relationship is used to associate an _IfcExternalReference_ (notably _IfcClassificationReference_ or _IfcLibraryReference_) with the profile.\n\n\n\n_IfcClassificationReference_ is used to refer to a profile norm (a common standard or manufacturer's standard). In this case,\n\n\n\n* _IfcClassificationReference.ItemReference_ contains the formal profile designation from the norm. (On the other hand, _IfcProfileDef.ProfileName_ contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)\n\n* _IfcClassificationReference.Name_ carries the short name of the profile norm.\n\n* Optionally, the norm can be further described by _IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource_.\n\n\n\n_IfcLibraryReference_ is used to refer to a library which contains profile definitions. In this case,\n\n\n\n* _IfcLibraryReference.ItemReference_ contains the identifier of the profile within the library and is meant to be machine-readable (in contrast to _IfcProfileDef.ProfileName_ which should be human-readable).\n\n* _IfcLibraryReference.Location_ and ._Name_ or ._ReferencedLibrary_ further describe the library.\n\n\n\nIf an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the referenced classification or library.\n\n\n\n**Direct instances of _IfcProfileDef_**\n\n\n\nUsually, only subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ should be instantiated. In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes other than geometric models (e.g. for structural analysis models), it may be possible to directly instantiate _IfcProfileDef_ and further specify the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter are tracked by the inverse attribute _HasProperties_.\n\n\n",

Curtain wall is represented as a building element assembly and implemented as a subtype of _IfcBuildingElement_ that uses an _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.\n\n\n\n{ .extDef}\n\n> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1: non load bearing wall positioned on the outside of a building and enclosing it.\n\n\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0\n\n\n\nThe geometric representation of _IfcCurtainWall_ is given by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, allowing multiple geometric representations. Independent 'Body' geometric representation, as described below, should only be used when the _IfcCurtainWall_ is not defined as an aggregate. If defined as an aggregate, the geometric representation is the sum of the representations of the components within the aggregate.\n\n\n\nThe geometric representation of _IfcCurtainWall_ is defined using the following multiple shape representations for its definition:\n\n\n\n* Axis: A two-dimensional open curve (for restrictions see below) defining the axis for the curtain wall. \n\n    * This is an optional representation for curtain walls. \n\n* Body: A surface model or boundary representation model representation defining the 3D shape of the curtain wall. \n\n    * If the _IfcCurtainWall_ has components (referenced by _SELF\\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy_) then no independent shape representation with _RepresentationType_ = 'Body' shall be defined. The body of _IfcCurtainWall_ is then geometrically represented by the shape representation of its components. The components are accessed via _SELF\\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy[1].RelatedObjects_. \n\n    * If the _IfcCurtainWall_ has no components defined (empty set of _SELF\\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy_) then the _IfcCurtainWall_ may be represented by an shape representation with the _RepresentationIdentifier_ ='Body'.\n\n\n",

The following parameters are given: \n\n\n\n* at the _IfcDoor_ or _IfcDoorStandardCase_ for occurrence specific parameters.

The door parametric representation uses this profile in order to apply the door lining and panel parameter.

The purpose of the parameter is described at those entities and below (door opening operation by door type).  \n\nThe overall size of the _IfcDoor_ to be used to apply the lining or panel parameter provided by the _IfcDoorType_ is determined by the IfcShapeRepresentation with the RepresentationIdentifier = 'Profile'.\n\n\n",

These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows:\n\n\n\n* Impart control over flow control elements (_IfcFlowController_) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (_IfcActuator_).\n\n* Sensing elements (_IfcSensor_) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.\n\n* Controllers (_IfcController_) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.\n\n\n\nSince _IfcDistributionControlElement_ and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (_IfcDistributionFlowElement_), the objectified relationship _IfcRelFlowControlElements_ has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.\n\n\n\nThe key distinction between _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ and _IfcDistributionControlElement_ is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between _IfcFlowMeter_ (subtype of _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ measuring a flow quantity) and _IfcFlowInstrument_ (subtype of _IfcDistributionControlElement_ measuring a flow quality), is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures (having inlet/outlet pipes for the measured substance) follows the _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ hierarchy (and therefore _IfcFlowMeter_ which measures the flow internally). Otherwise, if it monitors/controls but does not connect inline within the flow system (it is external or is a component of another device), then it follows the _IfcDistributionControlElement_ hierarchy (and therefore _IfcFlowInstrument_ which may display various attributes through connected sensors).\n\n\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0.\n\n\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Attribute _ControlElementId_ attribute deleted; replaced by classification usage. Ports are now primarily defined using _IfcRelNests_ to enable definition of ports at type definitions (both forward and backward compatible), provide a logical order, and reduce the number of relationship objects needed. The relationship _IfcRelConnectsPortToElement_ is still supported, however is now specific to dynamically connected ports.\n\n\n"

An asset is a group that can contain one or more elements. Whilst the financial value of a component or element can be defined, financial value is also defined for accounting purposes at the level of the asset.  \n\n  \n\nThere are a number of actors that can be associated with an asset, each actor having a role. Actors within the scope of the project are indicated using the [IfcRelAssignsToActor](../../ifckernel/lexical/ifcrelassignstoactor.htm) relationship in which case roles should be defined through the [IfcActorRole](../../ifcactorresource/lexical/ifcactorrole.htm) class; otherwise principal actors are identified as attributes of the class. In the existence of both, direct attributes take precedence.  \n\n  \n\nThere are a number of costs that can be associated with an asset, each cost having a role. These are specified through the _OriginalValue_, _CurrentValue_, _TotalReplacementCost_ and _DepreciatedValue_ attributes.\n\n\n\n> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x.\n\n\n\n{ .change-ifc2x4}\n\n> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; All attributes made optional and date values changed to use _IfcDate_.\n\n\n",

This coordinate system is established by _SELF\\IfcProduct.ObjectPlacement_. (This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the _IfcProject_'s world coordinate system.)\n\n* The so-called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item (connection or member).
