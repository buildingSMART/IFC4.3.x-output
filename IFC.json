The purpose of an IfcLaborResource is to identify a skillset that may be required or used.

It can be used to identify the generic type of labour resource that is required for a purpose without having to be specific about the actor person or organization providing the resource occurrence. It may be particularly useful when creating an overall plan for a process or processes. For instance, within maintenance or work planning there may be a known task that needs to be done which is planned to require a chargehand pipe fitter . There may be several such labour resources available and so the need to identify which will be used is not necessary at the planning stage. At a later stage, individual actors can be determined for the labour resources. This is achieved through specifying the actor through IfcActor . The actor is then identified as the labour resource occurrence through the IfcRelAssignsToResource.RelatedResource attribute. The IfcLaborResource provides the IfcRelAssignsToResource .

Magnetic ballasts are chokes which limit the current passing through a lamp connected in series on the principle of self induction. The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional EC A series and VVG Low loss ballasts EC B series . Low loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies approx. 35 40 kHz .",

EXAMPLE An example for a group is a system, since it groups elements under the aspect of their role, regardless of their position in a building. One of the most important usage of a group representing a system is the IfcDistributionSystem , that groups distribution components, such as space heaters and valves into a heating system. A group can hold any collection of objects, the relationship IfcRelAssignsToGroup is used to establish the group collection. Objects within a group are S products, processes, controls, resources, actors or other groups, thus groups can be nested. An object can be part of zero, one, or many groups. Grouping relationships are not required to be hierarchical nor do they imply a dependency. Groups are assigned to other objects such as a process or a resource by the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object Process assigned using IfcRelAssignsToProcess Resource assigned using IfcRelAssignsToResource Controls affecting the group using IfcRelAssignsToControl A group can be exchanged without having already objects within the group collection.

An IfcProduct occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an IfcProductDefinitionShape being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation with or without underlying geometry of the topological items . Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects referred to as elements for incorporation into an AEC FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations. In addition to physical products covered by the subtype IfcElement and spatial items covered by the subtype IfcSpatialElement the IfcProduct also includes non physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc. Any instance of IfcProduct defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar or identical occurrences of IfcProduct , is handled by the IfcTypeProduct and its subtypes , assigned to one or many occurrences of IfcProduct by using the objectified relationship IfcRelDefinesByType . The IfcTypeProduct may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences. NOTE See IfcTypeProduct for how to use a common geometric representation and IfcRelDefinesByType for using and overriding common properties. On a generic level products can be assigned to processes, controls, resources, project by using the relationship objects that refer to the corresponding object Having a control applied assigned using IfcRelAssignsToControl linking the IfcProduct to an IfcControl Being assigned to a process assigned using IfcRelAssignsToProcess linking the IfcProduct to an IfcProcess Being assigned to a resource assigned using IfcRelAssignsToResource linking the IfcProduct to an IfcResource EXAMPLE An example of the control relationship is the assignment of a performance history to a distribution element. An example of process assignment relationship is the assignment of products like wall, slab, column to a contruction task for construction planning. And an example of resource assignment relationship is the assignment of products to a construction resource that consumes the product. HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0 bSI Documentation",

The ProxyType may give an indication to which high level semantic breakdown of object the semantic definition of the proxy relates to. the Tag attribute may be used to assign a human or system interpretable identifier such as a serial number or bar code . NOTE Given that only a limited number of semantic constructs can be formally defined within IFC and it will never be possible to define all , there has to be a mechanism for capturing those constructs that are not yet defined by IFC.

There are two basic intended uses of IfcResource . First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of IfcResource , or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn t have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of IfcResource or its subtypes alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project. EXAMPLE construction equipment such as earth moving vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of IfcResource alone. Second, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of IfcResource objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the IfcResource instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced. Things that might be used as resources and that are already modeled in the IFC include physical products, people and organizations, and materials. The relationship object IfcRelAssignsToResource is provided for this approach. The inherited attribute ObjectType is used as a textual code that identifies the resource type.

Renamed from IfcWorkTask in IFC2x. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Attributes TaskTime and PredefinedType added. IfcMove and IfcOrderRequest has been removed in IFC4 and are now represented by IfcTask .

A textual description of the task may be provided and this may be further elaborated by a narrative long description IfcProcess.LongDescription . A work method may be declared for the method of work used in carrying out a task. A task is identified as being either a milestone task or not.

A status and priority for each task may also be set. .use head Time and duration use definition Compared to previous IFC releases, basic task time information scheduled start time, scheduled finish time, duration is now directly attached to IfcTask through the TaskTime attribute. Regular tasks are defined through IfcTaskTime . Recurring tasks are defined through IfcTaskTimeRecurring . In case a regular task is derived from a recurring task both tasks should be linked together through a IfcRelNests relationship, where IfcRelNests.IsNestedBy points to the recurring task and IfcRelNests.Nests points to all regular tasks that have been derived from the recurring task. .use head Representation of other activities The use definitions for IfcTask have been generalised to represent other activities as well, including activities that had been defined by own entities in previous IFC releases. This includes Order actions Move operations IfcTask represents an order that might be carried out by a Helpdesk acting the role of interface for the organization between the facility user and the functional requirement of fulfilling their needs. The actual task represented by the IfcTask entity is turning a request into an order and initiating the action that will enable the order to be completed. The IfcProjectOrder or one of its subtypes including maintenance work order, is related to the IfcTask using IfcRelAssignsToControl . IfcTask can also be used to describe an activity that moves people, groups within an organization or complete organizations together with their associated furniture and equipment from one place to another. It thus replaces the previous IFC entity IfcMove. The functionality is represented in IfcTask as follows Move from The place from which actors and their associated equipment are moving. Use IfcRelAssignsToProcess where RelatingProcess points to the task and RelatedObjects holds the location s from which to move. Move to The place to which actors and their associated equipment are moving.

The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology. NOTE See ISO 19148 Geographic information Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing. A single alignment may have a horizontal alignment defined in the x y plane of the engineering coordinate system an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along z coordinate space a relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and or at constant or variable offsets a 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data. Alignments may be aggregated into referents IfcReferent or derivative alignments. Derivative alignments may be used to indicate dependent alignments, such as an alignment for a bridge that is relative to a parent alignment for a road, where the child IfcAlignment may have Axis set to IfcOffsetCurveByDistances that starts and ends at a span within the extent of the IfcAlignmentCurve defined at the Axis of the parent IfcAlignment . Alignments may be assigned to groups using IfcRelAssignsToGroup , where IfcGroup or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments. Supported representations of IfcAlignment.Axis are IfcAlignmentCurve as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment represented by their alignment segments IfcAlignmentCurve as a 2D horizontal alignment represented by its horizontal alignment segments without a vertical alignment IfcOffsetCurveByDistances as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an IfcAlignmentCurve or another IfcOffsetCurveByDistances IfcPolyline as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation such as coming from a survey IfcPolyline as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation NOTE Although Axis is an IfcCurve base type, only derived types IfcAlignmentCurve , IfcOffsetCurveByDistances , and IfcPolyline are meant to be supported types.

Annotations include additional points, curves, text, dimensioning, hatching and other forms of graphical notes. It also includes virtual or symbolic representations of additional model components, not representing products or spatial structures, such as event elements, survey points, contour lines or similar. NOTE Additional presentation information often 2D such as tag number or hatching, that is directly related to a particular product representation is included within the IfcProductDefinitionShape having various IfcShapeRepresentation s of the IfcElement and its subtypes . Only those presentation information, that cannot be directly related to a single product, have to be wrapped within the IfcAnnotation. If available, the annotation should be related to the spatial context of the project, by containing the annotation within the appropriate level of the building structure site, facility, facility part or building, storey, or space . This is handled by the IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure relationship. The IfcAnnotation can provide specific 0D, 1D, and 2D geometric items as representation of the annotation, offering annotation point, curves, and surfaces. In addition to the predefined type values in IfcAnnotationTypeEnum, the following values can be used for the ObjectType with PredefinedType attribute value USERDEFINED . Annotation point is an annotation provided by a point that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of point annotation, some suggested values are SurveyPoint A single survey point represented by a Cartesian point. A property set may add the conditions method, accuracy, etc. to the survey point . SurveyArea A set of survey points represented by Cartesian point. These coordinates are determined relative to the coordinates of a reference point, which acts as the datum for the survey. Properties attached apply equally to all points. The difference in elevation of the survey points enables terrain to be determined. Annotation curve is an annotation provided by a curve that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of curve annotation, some suggested values are ContourLine A line of constant elevation typically used on geographic maps where the spacing of lines at constant intervals of elevation may be used as an indication of slope. IsoBar A line of constant pressure typically used on weather maps or to show pressure gradient in spaces, chambers or externally. IsoLux A line of constant illumination typically used to show the distribution of illumination levels and or day lighting in a space or externally. IsoTherm A line of constant temperature typically used to show the distribution and effect of heating or cooling within a space or to show temperature distribution on a geographic map. Annotation surface is an annotation provided by a surface that has additional semantic. The inherited attribute ObjectType should be used to capture the type of surface annotation, some suggested values are SurveyArea A surface patch based on survey points. bSI Documentation"

A building is if specified associated to a site. A building may span over several connected or disconnected buildings. Therefore building complex provides for a collection of buildings included in a site. A building can also be decomposed in vertical parts, where each part defines a building section. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElements which is interpreted as follow COMPLEX building complex ELEMENT building PARTIAL building section The IfcBuilding is used to build the spatial structure of a building that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical . The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates. Figure 150 shows the IfcBuilding as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements. NOTE Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.

        "Description": "An element is a generalization of all components that make up an AEC product. Elements are physically existent objects, although they might be void elements, such as holes. Elements either remain permanently in the AEC product, or only temporarily, as formwork does. Elements can be either assembled on site or pre manufactured and built in on site. EXAMPLE Examples of elements in a building construction context are walls, floors, windows and recesses. The elements can be logically contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a certain level within a project structure hierarchy site, building, storey or space . This is done by using the IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the IfcRelAssociatesMaterial and IfcRelDefinesByProperties relationship. In addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type and thereby be defined by the element type properties using the IfcRelDefinesByType relationship. An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the AEC product. Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the IfcRelAggregates relationship. EXAMPLE Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair, composed by Flights and Landings. Elements that performs the same function may be grouped by an Element Group By Function . It is realized by an instance of IfcGroup with the ObjectType ElementGroupByFunction .

Other examples include slab fields aggregated from a number of precast concrete slabs or reinforcement units made from several reinforcement bars. Also bathroom units, staircase sections and other premanufactured or precast elements are examples of the general IfcElementAssembly entity NOTE The IfcElementAssembly is a general purpose entity that is required to be decomposed. Also other subtypes of IfcElement can be decomposed. REMOVE with some dedicated entities such as IfcWallElementedCase and IfcSlabElementedCase . The assembly structure can be nested, i.e. an IfcElementAssembly could be an aggregated part within another IfcElementAssembly. NOTE View definitions and or implementer agreements may restrict the number of allowed levels of nesting. The geometry of an IfcElementAssembly is generally formed from its components, in which case it does not need to have an explicit geometric representation. In some cases it may be useful to also expose an own explicit representation of the aggregate. NOTE View definitions or implementer agreements may further constrain the applicability of certain shape representations at the IfcElementAssembly in respect of the shape representations of its parts.

An IfcProjectionElement has to be linked to a element all subtypes of IfcElement by using the IfcRelProjectsElement relationship. Its existence depends on the existence of the master element. The relationship implies a Boolean union operation between the volume of the projection element and the volume of the element. The IfcProjectionElement shall not participate in the containment relationship, i.e. it is not linked directly to the spatial structure of the project. It has a mandatory ProjectsElements inverse relationship pointing to the IfcElement that is contained in the spatial structure. The inverse relationship ContainedInStructure shall be NIL.

        "Description": "A site is a defined area of land, possibly covered with water, on which the project construction is to be completed. A site may be used to erect, retrofit or turn down building s , or for other construction related developments. NOTE Term according to ISO6707 1 vocabulary area of land or water where construction work or other development is undertaken . A site may include a definition of the single geographic reference point for this site global position using WGS84 with Longitude, Latitude and Elevation . The precision is provided up to millionth of a second and it provides an absolute placement in relation to the real world as used in exchange with geospatial information systems. If asserted, the Longitude, Latitude and Elevation establish the point in WGS84 where the point 0.,0.,0. of the LocalPlacement of IfcSite is situated. The geometrical placement of the site, defined by the IfcLocalPlacement, shall be always relative to the spatial structure element, in which this site is included, or absolute, i.e. to the world coordinate system, as established by the geometric representation context of the project. The world coordinate system, established at the IfcProject.RepresentationContexts, may include a definition of the true north within the XY plane of the world coordinate system, if provided, it can be obtained at IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.TrueNorth. A project may span over several connected or disconnected sites. Therefore site complex provides for a collection of sites included in a project. A site can also be decomposed in parts, where each part defines a site section. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype IfcSpatialStructureElements which is interpreted as follow COMPLEX site complex ELEMENT site PARTIAL site section The IfcSite is used to build the spatial structure of a building that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical . Figure 181 shows the IfcSite as part of the spatial structure. In addition to the logical spatial structure, also the placement hierarchy is shown. In this example the spatial structure hierarchy and the placement hierarchy are identical. NOTE Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements. site composition Figure 181 Site composition Figure 182 describes the heights and elevations of the IfcSite. It is used to provide the geographic longitude, latitude, and height above sea level for the origin of the site. The origin of the site is the local placement. The provision of longitude, latitude, height at the IfcSite for georeferencing is provided for upward compatibility reasons. It requires a single instance of IfcSite and WGS84 as coordinate reference system. For exact georeferencing or referencing to any other geographic coordinate system other than WSG84 the entities IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem and IfcMapConversion have to be used to define an exact mapping of the project engineering coordinate system to the geographic or map coordinate system. reference height of site is provided by IfcSite.RefElevation, it is given according to the height datum used at this location. the reference height of each building situated at the site is given against the same height datum used at this location. the elevations of each storey belonging to each building are given as local height relative to the reference height of the building.

        "Description": "A spatial structure element is the generalization of all spatial elements that might be used to define a spatial structure. That spatial structure is often used to provide a project structure to organize a building project. A spatial project structure might define as many levels of decomposition as necessary for the building project. Elements within the spatial project structure are site as IfcSite facility as IfcFacility , or any of its specific subtypes. REMOVE specifically building as IfcBuilding bridge as IfcBridge facility part as IfcFacilityPart, REMOVE or specifically storey as IfcBuildingStorey bridge part as IfcBridgePart space as IfcSpace or aggregations or parts thereof. The composition type declares an element to be either an element itself, or an aggregation complex or a decomposition part . The interpretation of these types is given at each subtype of IfcSpatialStructureElement. The IfcRelAggregates is defined as an 1 to many relationship and used to establish the relationship between exactly two levels within the spatial project structure. Finally the highest level of the spatial structure is assigned to IfcProject using the IfcRelAggregates. The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to other elements and systems by establishing the following relationships Containment of elements IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ContainsElements , used to assign any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. to the spatial structure element in which they are primarily contained. Reference of elements IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ReferencesElements, used to reference any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. in spatial structure elements, other then the one, where it is contained. Reference of systems REMOVE IfcRelServicesBuildings by inverse attribute ServicedBySystems , used to reference a sytem, IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ReferencesElements, used to reference a system, like a building service or electrical distribution system, a zonal system, or a structural analysis system, that is assigned to this spatial structure element. The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to each other by using the IfcRelAggregates relationship to build the project spatial structure. Figure 1 shows the use of IfcRelAggregates to establish a spatial structure including site, building, building section and storey. More information is provided at the level of the subtypes.

The IfcTransportElement defines the occurrence of a transport element, that if given , is expressed by the IfcTransportElementType . EXAMPLE Transportation elements include elevator lift , escalator, moving walkway, etc. NOTE More detailed equipment that may be a part of a transportation device, like a lifting hook, is defined as IfcDiscreteAccessory . It maybe included as a part of the IfcTransportElement by virtue of the objectified relationship IfcRelAggregates . Transport element can describe fixed or non fixed elements, which can either be identified as specified operational assets within a facility or vehicles that interact with the facility as a user or customer. In the case of operational assets, instances of IfcTransportElements can represent individual identifiable vehicles or structures with properties such as serial numbers, registration numbers etc. and be typed accordingly by instances of IfcTransportElementType. In the case transport elements that interact as users or customers, such as cars on a road or vessels at a port, IfcTransportElementType is used to define element specifications which are used to design, analyse and provide operational constraints to the facility. Depending on local classification systems transport elements and transportation systems in buildings are either considered as part of a built system, or as part of a built service system. Within IFC they are considered as part of a built system and may have to be mapped appropriately. bSI Documentation",

      "IfcProfileDef": {
        "Description": "IfcProfileDef is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry. Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters. Arbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries. Derived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available. In addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile. HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Changed from ABSTRACT to non abstract for uses which do not require an explicitly defined geometry. Added inverse attributes HasProperties and HasExternalReference . Use in material association Beams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition, by means of IfcRelAssociatesMaterial together with IfcMaterialProfileSet and IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage . This way, building elements and element types with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and association. The profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with shape representations of the respective building elements. A higher level description of spatial aligment of the section profile of a member such as centered, bottom left, in the geometric centroid, and more can be provided within IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage by means of a cardinal point reference. This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent. Use in shape models Profile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or sectioned spines. The purpose of the profile definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define a uniform cross section being swept along a line extrusion using IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion or IfcExtrudedAreaSolid along a circular arc revolution using IfcSurfaceOfRevolution or IfcRevolvedAreaSolid along a directrix lying on a reference surface using IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid The purpose of the profile definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype IfcDerivedProfileDef is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the identity of vertices and edges. NOTE Subtypes of the IfcProfileDef contain parameterized profiles as subtypes of IfcParameterizedProfileDef which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given by explicit curve geometry either open or closed profiles and two special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a 2D Cartesian transformation. An IfcProfileDef is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to AREA. An IfcProfileDef is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this case, the inside of the profile if the curve is closed is not part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to CURVE. Figure 1 illustrates use of parameterized profiles within a swept area solid. Position The IfcProfileDef is defined within the underlying coordinate system which is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of IfcSweptSurface.Position or of IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position or of each list member of IfcSectionedSpine.CrossSectionPositions. In the figure to the left, the z axis of the position coordinate system points outwards of the drawing plane. Note The subtype IfcParameterizedProfileDef optionally provides an additional 2D position coordinate system relative to the underlying coordinate system of the IfcProfileDef. Sweeping In the later use of the IfcProfileDef within the swept surface or swept area solid, e.g. the IfcExtrudedAreaSolid here used as an example , the profile boundaries here based on the 2D position coordinate system of IfcParameterizedProfileDef are placed within the xy plane of the 3D position coordinate system of the swept surface or swept area solid. The profile is inserted into the underlying coordinate system either directly in case of using IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef and IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef, through an intermediate position coordinate system in case of using IfcParameterizedProfileDef. through an 2D Cartesian transformation operator applied directly to the curve position when using arbitrary profile definitions, or applied to the position coordinate system when using parameterized profile definitions in case of using IfcDerivedProfileDef. when using IfcCompositeProfileDef the insertion depends on the subtype of the included sub profiles. Figure 1 Profile sweeping Profile types Results of the different usage of the ProfileType attribute are demonstrated here. The ProfileType defines whether the inside the bounded area is part of the profile definition Area or not Curve . Figure 2 illustrates the resulting area or curve depending on ProfileType . ProfileType AREA ProfileType CURVE Figure 2 Profile types Profile specification by external reference If the profile is standardized by a norm or a catalogue, a reference to this norm or catalogue should be provided by means of HasExternalReference . This inverse relationship is used to associate an IfcExternalReference notably IfcClassificationReference or IfcLibraryReference with the profile. IfcClassificationReference is used to refer to a profile norm a common standard or manufacturer s standard . In this case, IfcClassificationReference.ItemReference contains the formal profile designation from the norm. On the other hand, IfcProfileDef.ProfileName contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation. IfcClassificationReference.Name carries the short name of the profile norm. Optionally, the norm can be further described by IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource . IfcLibraryReference is used to refer to a library which contains profile definitions. In this case, IfcLibraryReference.ItemReference contains the identifier of the profile within the library and is meant to be machine readable in contrast to IfcProfileDef.ProfileName which should be human readable . IfcLibraryReference.Location and . Name or . ReferencedLibrary further describe the library. If an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the referenced classification or library. Direct instances of IfcProfileDef Usually, only subtypes of IfcProfileDef should be instantiated. In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes other than geometric models e.g. for structural analysis models , it may be possible to directly instantiate IfcProfileDef and further specify the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter are tracked by the inverse attribute HasProperties . bSI Documentation",

It is not required to be load bearing. .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO 6707 1 structural member for carrying load s between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so. NOTE The representation of load bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of IfcStructuralMember with IfcStructuralCurveMember being mostly applicable as part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel . NOTE For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity IfcMember should be used. The camber of a beam may be defined by assigning a StructuralCurveMember with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction. There are two entities for beam occurrences IfcBeamStandardCase used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage . These beams are always represented geometricly by an Axis and a SweptSolid or AdvancedSweptSolid shape representation or by a Clipping geometry based on the swept solid , if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage assigned. NOTE Model view definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, for example, by excluding tapering from an IfcBeamStandardCase implementation. IfcBeam used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only AdvancedBrep , Brep , SurfaceModel , or Tessellation geometry. NOTE Model view definitions and implementer agreements may impose the use of IfcBeam in all cases by excluding IfcBeamStandardCase from scope of the model view.

One use of the proxy object is a provision for voids, i.e. where a particular volume of space is requested by an engineering function that might later be accepted or rejected. If accepted it is transformed into a void within a building element, like a wall opening, or a slab opening. The provision for voids is exchanged as an IfcBuildingElementProxy with the PredefinedType ProvisionForVoid. Such proxy shall have a swept solid geometry, where the profile of the swept solid lies on near the surface of the referred building element and the extrusion depths is equal to or bigger then in case of round or otherwise irregular element shape the thickness of the building element. The appropriate property set should be attached. In addition to the provision for voids, the building element proxy can also represent a provision for space, often the necessary space allocation for mechanical equipment that will be determined in a later design phase. The provision for space is exchanged as an IfcBuildingElementProxy with the PredefinedType ProvisionForSpace.

It represents a vertical, or nearly vertical, structural member that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. It represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing. .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO 6707 1 structural member of slender form, usually vertical, that transmits to its base the forces, primarily in compression, that are applied to it. NOTE The representation of a column in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralCurveMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel . NOTE For any longitudial structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity IfcMember exists. The IFC specification provides two entities for column occurrences IfcColumnStandardCase used for all occurrences of columns, tthat have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage . These beams are always represented geometricly by an Axis and a SweptSolid or AdvancedSweptSolid shape representation or by a Clipping geometry based on the swept solid , if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage assigned. NOTE View definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, for example by excluding tapering from an IfcColumnStandardCase implementation. IfcColumn used for all other occurrences of columns, particularly for columns with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or columns defined by non linear extrusion, or columns having only Brep , or SurfaceModel geometry.

It includes constructions with hinged, pivoted, sliding, and additionally revolving and folding operations. REMOVE A door consists of a lining and one or several panels. NOTE Definition according to ISO 6707 1 construction for closing an opening, intended primarily for access with hinged, pivoted or sliding operation. The IfcDoor defines a particular occurrence of a door inserted in the spatial context of a project. A door can be inserted as a filler in an opening using the IfcRelFillsElement relationship, then the IfcDoor has an inverse attribute FillsVoids provided NOTE View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict the relationship to only include one door into one opening be part of an element assembly, in general an IfcCurtainWall , using the IfcRelAggregates relationship, then the IfcDoor has an inverse attribute Decomposes is provided be a free standing door, then the IfcDoor has no inverse attributes FillsVoids or Decomposes provided. This specification provides two entities for door occurrences IfcDoorStandardCase used for all occurrences of doors, that have a Profile shape representation defined to which a set of shape parameters for lining and framing properties apply. Additionally it requires the provision of an IfcDoorType that references one IfcDoorLiningProperties and on to many IfcDoorPanelProperties NOTE see IfcDoorStandardCase for all specific constraints imposed by this subtype. IfcDoor used for all other occurrences of doors, particularly for doors having only Brep , or SurfaceModel geometry without applying shape parameters. The actual parameters of the door and or its shape are defined by the IfcDoor as the occurrence definition or project instance , or by the IfcDoorType as the specific definition or project type . The following parameters are given at the IfcDoor or IfcDoorStandardCase for occurrence specific parameters. The IfcDoor specifies the door width and height the door opening direction by the y axis of the ObjectPlacement at the IfcDoorType , to which the IfcDoor is related by the inverse relationship IsTypedBy pointing to IfcRelDefinesByType , for type parameters common to all occurrences of the same type. at the IfcDoorType, to which the IfcDoor is related by the inverse relationship IsTypedBy pointing to IfcRelDefinesByType, for type parameters common to all occurrences of the same type. the operation type single swing, double swing, revolving, etc. the door hinge side by using two different styles for right and left opening doors the construction material type the particular attributes for the lining by the IfcDoorLiningProperties the particular attributes for the panels by the IfcDoorPanelProperties The geometric representation of IfcDoor is given by the IfcProductDefinitionShape , allowing multiple geometric representations. The IfcDoor may get its parameter and shape from the IfcDoorType . If an IfcRepresentationMap a block definition is defined for the IfcDoorType , then the IfcDoor inserts it through the IfcMappedItem . The geometric representation of IfcDoor is defined using the following potentially multiple IfcShapeRepresentation s for its IfcProductDefinitionShape Profile A Curve3D consisting of a single losed curve defining the outer boundary of the door lining . The door parametric representation uses this profile in order to apply the door lining and panel parameter. If not provided, the profile of the IfcOpeningElement is taken.

        "Description": "An IfcMember is a structural member designed to carry loads between or beyond points of support. It is not required to be load bearing. The orientation of the member being horizontal, vertical or sloped is not relevant to its definition in contrary to IfcBeam and IfcColumn . An IfcMember represents a linear structural element from an architectural or structural modeling point of view and shall be used if it cannot be expressed more specifically as either an IfcBeam or an IfcColumn . NOTE The representation of a member in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralCurveMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel . The IFC specification provides two entities for member occurrences IfcMemberStandardCase used for all occurrences of members, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage . These beams are always represented geometricly by an Axis and a SweptSolid or AdvancedSweptSolid shape representation or by a Clipping geometry based on the swept solid , if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage assigned. NOTE View definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, such as by excluding tapering from an IfcMemberStandardCase implementation. IfcMember used for all other occurrences of members, particularly for members with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or members defined by non linear extrusion, or members having only Brep , or SurfaceModel geometry.

The location of the plate being horizontal, vertical or sloped is not relevant to its definition in contrary to IfcWall and IfcSlab as floor slab . .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO 6707 1 thin, rigid, flat, metal product, of a thickness greater than that of a sheet. Plates are S normally made of steel, other metallic material, or by glass panels. However the definition of IfcPlate is material independent and specific material information shall be handled by using IfcAssociatesMaterial to assign a material specification to the IfcPlate . NOTE S Although not necessarily, plates are often add on parts. This is represented by the IfcRelAggregates decomposition mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as IfcPlate , into a container element such as IfcElementAssembly or IfcCurtainWall . NOTE The representation of a plate in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralSurfaceMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel . An instance IfcPlate should preferably get its geometric representation and material assignment through the type definition by IfcPlateType assigned using the IfcRelDefinesByType relationship. This allows identical plates in a construction to be represented by the same instance of IfcPlateType . A plate may have openings, such as voids or recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the plate using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement . The position number of a plate as often used in steel construction is assigned through the attribute IfcElement.Tag The IFC specification provides two entities for plate occurrences IfcPlateStandardCase used for all occurrences of plates, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage . These plates are always represented geometrically by a SweptSolid geometry or by a Clipping geometry based on SweptSolid , if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage assigned. IfcPlate used for all other occurrences of plates, particularly for plates with changing thickness, or plates with non planar surfaces, and plates having only SurfaceModel or Brep geometry.

An IfcRampFlight is an aggregated part of an IfcRamp realized through the IfcRelAggregates relationship, the ramp flight is therefore included in the set of IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects . An IfcRampFlight connects the floor slab of zero to two different storeys or partial storeys or landings within a building.

Only the core or constructional part of this construction is considered to be a slab. The upper finish flooring, roofing and the lower finish ceiling, suspended ceiling are considered to be coverings. A special type of slab is the landing, described as a floor section to which one or more stair flights or ramp flights connect. NOTE There is a representation of slabs for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of IfcStructuralMember being part of the IfcStructuralAnalysisModel . NOTE S An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable or irrelevant shall be modeled as IfcPlate . A slab may have openings, such as floor openings, or recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the slab using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement . There are three entities for slab occurrences IfcSlabStandardCase used for all occurrences of slabs, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage . These slabs are always represented geometrically by a SweptSolid geometry or by a Clipping geometry based on SweptSolid , if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage assigned. IfcSlabElementedCase used for occurrences of slabs which are aggregated from subordinate elements, following specific decomposition rules expressed by the mandatory use of IfcRelAggregates relationship. IfcSlab used for all other occurrences of slabs, particularly for slabs with changing thickness, or slabs with non planar surfaces, and slabs having only SweptSolid or Brep geometry.

NOTE There is a representation of walls for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of IfcStructuralMember being part of the IfcStructuralAnalysisModel . NOTE An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable is not predominantly vertical , shall be modeled as IfcPlate . A wall may have openings, such as wall openings, openings used for windows or doors, or niches and recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the wall using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement . NOTE Walls with openings that have already been modeled within the enclosing geometry may use the relationship IfcRelConnectsElements to associate the wall with embedded elements such as doors and windows. There are three entities for wall occurrences IfcWallStandardCase S used for all occurrences of walls, that have a non changing thickness along the wall path and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by a material layer set. These walls are always represented geometrically by an Axis and a SweptSolid shape representation or by a Clipping geometry based on SweptSolid , if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage assigned. IfcWallElementedCase used for occurrences of walls which are aggregated from subordinate elements, following specific decomposition rules expressed by the mandatory use of IfcRelAggregates relationship. IfcWall S used for all other occurrences of wall, particularly for walls with changing thickness along the wall path e.g. polygonal walls , or walls with a non rectangular cross sections e.g. L shaped retaining walls , and walls having an extrusion axis that is unequal to the global Z axis of the project i.e. non vertical walls , or walls having only Brep , or SurfaceModel geometry.

NOTE View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict the relationship to only include one window or door into one opening. There are two entities for window occurrences IfcWindowStandardCase used for all occurrences of windows, that have a Profile shape representation defined to which a set of shape parameters for lining and framing properties apply.

IfcDistributionControlElement defines elements of a building automation control system. These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows Impart control over flow control elements IfcFlowController in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation IfcActuator . Sensing elements IfcSensor that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow. Controllers IfcController typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control. Since IfcDistributionControlElement and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements IfcDistributionFlowElement , the objectified relationship IfcRelFlowControlElements has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required. The key distinction between IfcDistributionFlowElement and IfcDistributionControlElement is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between IfcFlowMeter subtype of IfcDistributionFlowElement measuring a flow quantity and IfcFlowInstrument subtype of IfcDistributionControlElement measuring a flow quality , is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures having inlet outlet pipes for the measured substance follows the IfcDistributionFlowElement hierarchy and therefore IfcFlowMeter which measures the flow internally . Otherwise, if it monitors controls but does not connect inline within the flow system it is external or is a component of another device , then it follows the IfcDistributionControlElement hierarchy and therefore IfcFlowInstrument which may display various attributes through connected sensors .

A common example is a heating hot water system that consists of a pump, a tank, and an interconnected piping system for distributing hot water to terminals. The group IfcDistributionSystem defines the occurrence of a specialized system for use within the context of building services or utilities for built facilities. Important functionalities for the description of a distribution system are derived from existing IFC entities From IfcSystem it inherits the ability to couple the built system via IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure to one or more IfcSpatialElement subtypes as necessary. From IfcGroup it inherits the inverse attribute IsGroupedBy, pointing to the relationship class IfcRelAssignsToGroup . This allows the grouping of distribution elements instances of IfcDistributionElement subtypes . From IfcObjectDefinition it inherits the inverse attribute IsDecomposedBy pointing to the relationship class IfcRelAggregates. It provides the hierarchy between the separate partial distribution systems. For example, an electrical main circuit may be aggregated into branch circuits.

Typical examples of IfcElementComponents include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories. One or several instances of subtypes of IfcElementComponent should always be accompanied by a defining instance of a respective subtype of IfcElementComponentType. The type object holds shape and material information. HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2 It is often desirable to model a number of same shaped element components by means of a single occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements. In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below. To express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level, a Qto ElementComponentPatternQuantities should be provided via IfcRelDefinesByProperties and contain the number of pieces which are placed by a single IfcElementComponent instance. Symbolic Representation A symbolic representation is defined for a row of components or several rows of components within a single instance of IfcElementComponent. Such rows or arrays may contain possibly large numbers of individual pieces. The product definition shape consists of an IfcShapeRepresentation with the attribute values RepresentationIdentifier Row RepresentationType GeometricCurveSet and one or several curves as geometric items. The curves represent where reference points of the pieces are located. For example, such reference points may be at the heads of mechanical fasteners or at the starting point of the extrusion axis of reinforcement bars. In case of straight components bolts, nails, staples, straight reinforcement bars, or similar , the local placement of the IfcElementComponent shall be located and oriented such that the local z axis is parallel with the axes of the components. A Qto ElementComponentPatternQuantities should denote the count of pieces in the row or array and their spacing. bSI Documentation",

The primary distinction from an IfcSign is that a signal is active and therefore a subtype of IfcFlowTerminal usually requiring power and data connections for its operation. An instance of IfcSignal represents a singular signalling device in a larger assembled unit or connected system, such as an individual frame within a railway signal, a single light unit in a traffic light system or an audio signal or light mounted on a navigational buoy. Signals can be physically aggregated together into an assembly which can include multiple signal instances and also sign instances and the associated supporting structural elements such as a simple pole or a rigid frame gantry see Signal Assembly for examples . Signals can be logically functionally grouped together into a signalling system a type of distribution system to represent a connected group of signals for example a group of traffic lights controlling an road intersection.",
