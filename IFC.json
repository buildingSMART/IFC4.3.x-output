        "Description": "The door lining is the frame which enables the door leaf to be fixed in position. The door lining is used to hang the door leaf. The parameters of the door lining define the geometrically relevant parameter of the lining.NOTE The IfcDoorLiningProperties shall only be applied by the receiving application to parametrically define the 3D shape of a door, if the attribute IfcDoorType.ParameterTakesPrecedence is set TRUE.The IfcDoorLiningProperties are included in the list of properties of IfcDoorType.HasPropertySets. More information about the door lining can be included in the same list of the IfcDoorType using another IfcPropertySet for dynamic extensions.The IfcDoorLiningProperties does not hold its own geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type (which is inserted by the IfcDoor into the spatial context of the project) as described below. The parameters of the IfcDoorLiningProperties define a standard door lining, including (if given) a threshold and a transom. The outer boundary of the lining is determined by the Profile shape representation assigned to the IfcDoor, which inserts the IfcDoorType.The lining is applied to the left, right and upper side of the opening reveal. The parameters areLiningDepth, if omitted, equal to wall thickness - this only takes effect if a value for LiningThickness is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no lining.LiningThicknessLiningToPanelOffsetXLiningToPanelOffsetYNOTE The parameters LiningToPanelOffsetX and LiningToPanelOffsetY are added in IFC4.The lining can only cover part of the opening reveal.LiningOffset, given if lining edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement.NOTE In addition to theLiningOffset, the local placement of the IfcDoor can already have an offset to the wall edge and thereby shift the lining along the y axis. The actual position of the lining is calculated from the origin of the local placement along the positive y axis with the distance given by LiningOffset.The lining may include a casing, which covers part of the wall faces around the opening. The casing covers the left, right and upper side of the lining on both sides of the wall. The parameters areCasingDepthCasingThicknessThe lining may include a threshold, which covers the bottom side of the opening. The parameters areThresholdDepth, if omitted, equal to wall thickness - this only takes effect if a value for ThresholdThickness is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no threshold.ThresholdThicknessThresholdOffset (not shown in figure), given, if the threshold edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement.The lining may have a transom which separates the door panel from a window panel. The transom, if given, is defined byTransomOffset, a parallel edge to the x axis of the local placementTransomThicknessThe depth of the transom is identical to the depth of the lining and not given as separate parameter.NOTE LiningDepth describes the length of the lining along the reveal of the door opening. It can be given by an absolute value if the door lining has a specific depth depending on the door style. However often it is equal to the wall thickness. If the same door style is used (like the same type of single swing door), but inserted into different walls with different thicknesses, it would be necessary to create a special door style for each wall thickness. Therefore several CAD systems allow to set the value to automatically aligned to wall thickness. This should be exchanged by leaving the optional attribute LiningDepth unassigned. The same agreement applies to ThresholdDepth.HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0.

The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz).",

Therefore a group is an aggregation under some non-geometrical topological grouping aspects.EXAMPLE An example for a group is a system, since it groups elements under the aspect of their role, regardless of their position in a building. One of the most important usages of a group representing a system is the IfcDistributionSystem, that groups distribution components, such as space heaters and valves into a heating system.A group can hold any collection of objects, the relationship IfcRelAssignsToGroup is used to establish the group collection. Objects within a group areproducts, processes, controls, resources, actors or other groups, thus groups can be nested. An object can be part of zero, one, or many groups. Grouping relationships are not required to be hierarchical nor do they imply a dependency.A group can be referenced in a spatial structure using the relationship IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure, such as a mechanical distribution system that refers to a building.Groups are assigned to other objects (such as a process or a resource) by the relationship object that refers to the corresponding objectProcess assigned using IfcRelAssignsToProcessResource assigned using IfcRelAssignsToResourceControls affecting the group using IfcRelAssignsToControlA group can be exchanged without having already objects within the group collection.IfcGroup does not define an own object coordinate system, nor does it have an independent shape representation.NOTE Use IfcRelAggregates together with the appropriate subtypes of IfcProduct to define an aggregation of products that may have its own position and shape representation.

In effect, processes are glued together by means of such input output relationships.Process information relates to other objects by establishing the following relationshipsNesting of processes IfcRelNests - A process can contain sub processes and thereby be nested.Sequencing of processes IfcRelSequence - Processes can be placed in sequence (including overlapping for parallel tasks), and have predecessors and successors.Assigning process to schedules IfcRelAssignsToControl - Activities such as tasks, and predominately summary tasks, are assigned to a work schedule.Having a product assigned to the process as input IfcRelAssignsToProcess - Products can be assigned as input to a process, such as for construction process planning.Having a product assigned to the process as output IfcRelAssignsToProduct - Products can be assigned as output to a process, such as for construction process planning.Having a control assigned to the process as process control IfcRelAssignsToProcess - Items that act as a control onto the process can be assigned to a process, such as for cost management (a cost item assigned to a work task).Having a resource assigned to the process as consumed by the process IfcRelAssignsToProcess - Items that act as a mechanism to a process, such as labor, material and equipment in cost calculations.HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0.IFC2x CHANGE The attribute Productivity has been removed.IFC4 CHANGE The attribute Identification has been promoted from subtypes IfcTask and others.",

An IfcProduct occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an IfcProductDefinitionShape being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items).Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AECFM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype IfcElement) and spatial items (covered by the subtype IfcSpatialElement) the IfcProduct also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.Any instance of IfcProduct defines a particular occurrence of a product. The common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of IfcProduct, is handled by the IfcTypeProduct (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of IfcProduct by using the objectified relationship IfcRelDefinesByType. The IfcTypeProduct may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.NOTE See IfcTypeProduct for how to use a common geometric representation and IfcRelDefinesByType for using and overriding common properties.On a generic level products can be assigned to processes, controls, resources, project by using the relationship objects that refer to the corresponding objectHaving a control applied assigned using IfcRelAssignsToControl linking the IfcProduct to an IfcControlBeing assigned to a process assigned using IfcRelAssignsToProcess linking the IfcProduct to an IfcProcessBeing assigned to a resource assigned using IfcRelAssignsToResource linking the IfcProduct to an IfcResourceEXAMPLE An example of the control relationship is the assignment of a performance history to a distribution element. An example of process assignment relationship is the assignment of products like wall, slab, column to a construction task for construction planning. And an example of resource assignment relationship is the assignment of products to a construction resource that consumes the product.HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0",

Or they may require some form of physical containment, thus establishing special types of aggregation relationships.NOTE There are two special names for decomposition, which are linguistically distinguished, nesting and aggregation. The subtypes of IfcRelDecomposes will introduce either the nesting or aggregation convention (see IfcRelNests and IfcRelAggregates).EXAMPLE A cost element is a nest of other cost elements. Or a structural frame is an aggregation of beams and columns. Both are applications of decomposition relationship.Decompositions imply a dependency, i.e. the definition of the whole depends on the definition of the parts and the parts depend on the existence of the whole. The decomposition relationship can be applied in a recursive manner, i.e. a decomposed element can be part in another decomposition. Cyclic references have to be prevented at application level.HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5, it is a generalisation of the IFC2.0 entity IfcRelNests.IFC4 CHANGE The differentiation between the aggregation and nesting is determined to be a non-ordered or an ordered collection of parts.

Many occurrences of IfcRelSequence may exist to describe the sequence relationships of a predecessor task with many successor tasks or of many predecessor tasks with one successor task, thus enabling a mn sequence relationship between tasks. Please note that sequence relationships can be used to define dependencies between process occurrences but also between process types (for further information see IfcRelDefinesByObject and IfcTaskType). In case of defining dependencies between process occurrences sequence relationships should stay within the limits of a directed, non-cyclic graph.A sequence type may be set for a sequence. For tasks assigned to a work schedule, it is expected that the sequence type will be asserted. For a process map, where the sequence relationship between processes is simply a logical flow, it need not be asserted.A time lag may be assigned to a sequence, and the sequence type defines the way in which the time lag applies to the sequence either as a ratio or percentage of time duration (e.g. start successor task when predecessor is 50 complete) or as a time measure (e.g. start successor task 1 week after commencement of the predecessor task).

The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology.NOTE See ISO 19148 Geographic information Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing.Kinematic perspectiveIn the kinematic perspective, the focus is on the safe and optimized movement of a vehicle under the constraints induced by changes in the direction of the horizontal and the vertical layout.Geometric perspectiveIn the geometric perspective the focus is on the proper placement of horizontal and vertical segments to connect certain points along a proposed path. A huge body of knowledge has been developed over a long period of time, in many aspects predating the availability of modern computers and their software.Supported shape representations of IfcAlignment areIfcCompositeCurve as a 2D horizontal alignment (represented by its horizontal alignment segments), without a vertical layout.IfcGradientCurve as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment (represented by their alignment segments), without a cant layout.IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve as a 3D curve defined relative to an IfcGradientCurve to incorporate the application of cant.IfcOffsetCurveByDistances as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an IfcGradientCurve or another IfcOffsetCurveByDistances.IfcPolyline or IfcIndexedPolyCurve as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation (such as coming from a survey).IfcPolyline or IfcIndexedPolyCurve as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation (such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation).State of the art in contemporary engineeringGenerally, contemporary engineering follows these steps when defining an alignment.First, a horizontal layout in a properly projected plane is established.In a second step, the vertical layout (i.e. sequence of segments with constant gradients, together with smoothing segments showing a variation in gradient) is added.In the rail domain, in most cases a cant layout is added to the horizontal layout to compensate a part of the unwanted lateral acceleration.In a final step, the proposed layout is checked against a defined set of rules, formulas and thresholds to guarantee the conformance against the regulation.The sequence of steps might change from case to case and might be repeated one or more times to achieve the economic objectives and fulfill regulatory safety requirements.Contemporary alignment design almost always implements a 2.5 dimension approach. The resulting and documented geometry might be very precise or just good enough to meet safety thresholds. This depends on factors like priorities of the management, date of the design - existing alignments might have been designed more then 50 years ago - or software tools used. Working with legacy data in a high precision BIM model requires a good understanding of these factors.Distinction between business logic and geometry definitionThe alignment concept is organised into two parts. These two parts work together, but they can also be used and exchanged independently.Business logic of alignmentGeometry definition of alignmentBusiness logic the IFC schema allows to describe an alignment using terminology and concepts that are as close as possible to business ones. It allows to describe the layouts that make up the alignment (i.e. horizontal, vertical, cant), their segments structure and attributes. Also, the business logic part provides the anchor point for domain specific properties, such as design speed or cant deficiency.Geometry definition the IFC schema provides well established IFC geometric entities to represent the business concepts.A mapping between the business logic and its geometry definition in IFC is described by the concept templates related to the alignment geometry.",

The first value is the distance along the horizontal alignment, and the second value is the height relative to the projection of the point along vertical alignment.Cant as a railway specificityNOTE Figure 1 was first published in (Basics of) Railway Curve Kinematics Presentation, (Wojtczak 2018)The diagram in the figure above shows the principle of compensating part of the lateral acceleration by elevating the outer rail relative to the inner rail of a track.Almost always the following principles for the placement of horizontal segments and cant segments are implementedStraight horizontal line no applied cantHorizontal circular arc constant applied cantHorizontal transition bend variation of applied cant according to a defined formulaIn specific difficult topographic environments like mountain lines the extension of a cant transition may differ from the horizontal transition. So far this has only been found for clothoids and is either a so called shortened ramp (cant transition is shorter than the corresponding horizontal curvature transition) or a so called scissor ramp (overlapping variations of cant on both rails with opposite direction).Application of high-performance horizontal transition bends is always combined with a cant transition with identical start and end location.In real world designs, such as slow speed sections in railway stations, exceptions to the above principles can be found. It might even happen that the inner rail is elevated relative to the outer rail.Detailed geometric modelling of the superelevation has a low priority in the existing processes in most rail companies. This will very probably change with the introduction of 3D modelling in rail design. The following list shows some use casesCorrect 3D placement of certain assets (e.g. sleepers)Relevant input for calculation of structural gauge spaceCorrect calculation of horizontal coordinate values for the Viennese Bend (high performance transition bend)",

        "Description": "An element is a generalization of all components that make up a facility.Elements are physically existent objects, although they might be void elements, such as holes. Elements either remain permanently in the facility, or only temporarily, as formwork does. Elements can be either assembled on site or pre-manufactured and built in on site.EXAMPLE Examples of elements in a building construction context are walls, floors, windows and recesses.The elements can be logically contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a certain level within a project structure hierarchy (site, building, storey or space). This is done by using the IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the IfcRelAssociatesMaterial and IfcRelDefinesByProperties relationship.In addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type (and thereby be defined by the element type properties) using the IfcRelDefinesByType relationship. An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the facility. Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the IfcRelAggregates relationship.EXAMPLE Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair, composed by Flights and Landings.Elements that perform the same function may be grouped by an Element Group By Function. It is realized by an instance of IfcGroup with the ObjectType ElementGroupByFunction.HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0",

Elements could be spatial structure elements (like buildings, storeys, or spaces) or building elements (like walls, slabs, finishes). The IfcElementQuantity gets assigned to the element by using the IfcRelDefinesByProperties relationship.The optional MethodOfMeasurement attribute defines the code, e.g. from a standard method of measurement, which had been used to calculate the element quantity.NOTE The recognizable values for the name and the method of measurement attributes have to be agreed upon in further agreement documents, such as implementers agreements. Some of these agreements might be limited to a certain region, to which the method of measurement applies.The name attribute, given at the individual Quantities provides a recognizable semantic meaning of the element quantity. Both information is needed to establish a precise meaning for the measure value. An optional description may be assigned to each of the Quantities. All quantities assigned by a single instance of IfcElementQuantity are deemed to have been generated according to the same method of measurement. However several instances of IfcElementQuantity are assignable to an element, thus allowing for an element having quantities generated according to several methods of measurement.EXAMPLE To exchange the net floor area of spaces in the German region (as IfcSpace), the name might be Netto-Grundfl\u00e4che (net floor area), and the method of measurement might be accordingly DIN277-2 (German industry norm no. 277 edition 2).EXAMPLE The same instance of IfcSpace may have a different area measure assigned in the German region according to a housing regulation, the name would be Wohnfl\u00e4che and the method of measurement would be 2.BV. It would be attached to the IfcSpace by a separate IfcRelDefinesByProperties relationship.The IfcElementQuantity can have the following subtypes of IfcPhysicalQuantity within its SET of Quantities, which count for the basis measure types usedcount measureweight measurelength measurearea measurevolume measuretime measureBase quantities are quantity definitions that are independent of a particular method of measurement and therefore internationally applicable.

        "Description": "The space boundary defines the physical or virtual delimiter of a space by the relationship IfcRelSpaceBoundary to the surrounding elements.In the case of a physical space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and the building element, providing the boundary is referenced,In the case of a virtual space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and a virtual element is referenced.The IfcRelSpaceBoundary is defined as an objectified relationship that handles the element to space relationship by objectifying the relationship between an element and the space it bounds. It is given as a one-to-one relationship, but allows each element (including virtual elements and openings) to define many such relationships and each space to be defined by many such relationships.Space boundaries are always defined as seen from the space. In general two basic types of space boundaries are distinguished1st level space boundary defined as boundaries of the space, not taking into account any change in building element or spaces on the other side.2nd level space boundary defined as boundary taking any change in building element or spaces on the other side into account. It can be further distinguished into2nd level type A There is a space on the other side.2nd level type B There is a building element on the other side.The exact definition of how space boundaries are broken down depends on the view definition, more detailed conventions on how space boundaries are decomposed can only be given at the domain or application type level.In an architectural or FM related view, a space boundary is defined totally from inside the space. This is a 1st level space boundary.In a thermal view, the decomposition of the space boundary depends on the material of the providing building element and the adjacent spaces behind. This is a 2nd level space boundary.Figure 1 \u2014 Space boundary at first levelFigure 2 \u2014 Space boundary at second levelFigure 3 \u2014 Space boundary at second level type AFigure 4 \u2014 Space boundary at second level type BThe differences between the 1st and 2nd level space boundaries are identified by1st level IfcRoot.Name 1stLevel IfcRoot.Description NIL2nd level IfcRoot.Name 2ndLevel IfcRoot.Description 2a, or 2bDifferentiation between physical and virtual space boundary is illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 6.As shown in Figure 5, if the IfcRelSpaceBoundary is used to express a virtual boundary, the attribute PhysicalOrVirtualBoundary has to be set to VIRTUAL. The attribute RelatedBuildingElement shall point to an instance of IfcVirtualElement. If the correct location is of interest, the attribute ConnectionGeometry is required.NOTE The connection geometry, either by a 2D curve or a 3D surface, is used to describe the portion of the virtual wall that separates the two spaces. All instances of IfcRelSpaceBoundary given at the adjacent spaces share the same instance of IfcVirtualElement. Each instance of IfcRelSpaceBoundary provides in addition the ConnectionGeometry given within the local placement of each space.As shown in Figure 6, if the IfcRelSpaceBoundary is used to express a physical boundary between two spaces, the attribute PhysicalOrVirtualBoundary has to be set to PHYSICAL. The attribute RelatedBuildingElement has to be given and points to the element providing the space boundary. The attribute ConnectionGeometry may be inserted, in this case it describes the physical space boundary geometrically, or it may be omitted in that case it describes a physical space boundary logically.The IfcRelSpaceBoundary may have geometry attached. If geometry is not attached, the relationship between space and building element is handled only on a logical level. If geometry is attached, it is given within the local coordinate systems of the space.NOTE The attributes CurveOnRelatingElement at IfcConnectionCurveGeometry or SurfaceOnRelatingElement at IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry provide the geometry within the local coordinate system of the IfcSpace, whereas the attributes CurveOnRelatedElement at IfcConnectionCurveGeometry or SurfaceOnRelatedElement at IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry provide the geometry within the local coordinate system of the subtype of IfcElement.The geometric representation (through the ConnectionGeometry attribute) is defined using either 2D curve geometry or 3D surface geometry for space boundaries.1st level space boundaryonly connection geometry for related space shall be providedonly surface connection geometry shall be providedonly the following surface representations are supportedIfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusionIfcCurveBoundedPlaneIfcCurveBoundedSurfaceIfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel2nd level space boundaryonly connection geometry for related space shall be providedonly surface connection geometry shall be providedonly the following surface representations are supportedIfcCurveBoundedPlane with restrictions to have polygonal boundaries onlyIfcFaceBasedSurfaceModelSurface connection geometryThe following constraints apply to the surface connection geometry representationplanar boundariesIfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion defined by a SweptCurve being an IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef with straight segments, orIfcCurveBoundedPlanecurved boundariesIfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion defined by a SweptCurve being an IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef with curves segments, orIfcCurveBoundedSurface with a BasisSurface being a non planar surface, such as IfcCylindricalSurface, orIfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel if already faceted.Curve connection geometryThe following constraints apply to the 2D curve representationCurve IfcPolyline, IfcTrimmedCurve or IfcCompositeCurveHISTORY New entity in IFC1.5, the entity has been modified in IFC2x.IFC2x CHANGE The data type of the attribute RelatedBuildingElement has been changed from IfcBuildingElement to its supertype IfcElement.

A site may be used to erect, retrofit or turn down building(s), or for other construction related developments.NOTE Definition according to ISO 6707-1 area of land or water where construction work or other development is undertaken.Precise geospatial information of a site shall be derived from the georeferencing entities that relate the IfcProject to the real world, using sets of datum (see IfcCoordinateOperation and IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem).In small-scale projects (e.g., building), when georeferencing is not provided as recommended above, the Longitude, Latitude and Elevation attributes of IfcSite can be used for approximate indication of the site location. This methodology is not meant to replace precise georeferencing, but can still be useful for those use cases that do not require accurate geospatial information (e.g., sun shading simulations). If asserted, the Longitude, Latitude and Elevation establish the point in WGS84 where the point 0.,0.,0. of the LocalPlacement of IfcSite is situated.The geometrical placement of the site, defined by the IfcLocalPlacement, shall be always relative to the spatial structure element, in which this site is included, or absolute, i.e. to the world coordinate system, as established by the geometric representation context of the project. The world coordinate system, established at the IfcProject.RepresentationContexts, may include a definition of the true north within the XY plane of the world coordinate system, if provided, it can be obtained at IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.TrueNorth.A project may span over several connected or disconnected sites.

        "Description": "A spatial structure element is the generalization of all spatial elements that might be used to define a spatial structure. The spatial structure can be used to provide a spatial organization of a project.A spatial project structure might define as many levels of decomposition as necessary for the project. Elements within the spatial project structure aresite as IfcSitefacility as IfcFacility, or specificallybuilding as IfcBuildingbridge as IfcBridgemarine facility as IfcMarineFacilityrailway as IfcRailwayroad as IfcRoadfacility part as IfcFacilityPart, or specificallystorey as IfcBuildingStoreyfacility part as IfcFacilityPartspace as IfcSpaceor aggregations or parts thereof. The composition type declares an element to be either an element itself, or an aggregation (complex) or a decomposition (part). The interpretation of these types is given at each subtype of IfcSpatialStructureElement.The IfcRelAggregates is defined as an 1-to-many relationship and used to establish the relationship between exactly two levels within the spatial project structure. Finally the highest level of the spatial structure is assigned to IfcProject using the IfcRelAggregates.The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to other elements and systems by establishing the following relationshipsContainment of elements IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ContainsElements, used to assign any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. to the spatial structure element in which they are primarily contained.Reference of elements IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure by inverse attribute ReferencesElements, used to reference any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. in spatial structure elements, other then the one, where it is contained.Reference of systems IfcRelServicesBuildings by inverse attribute ServicedBySystems, used to reference a system, like a building service or electrical distribution system, a zonal system, or a structural analysis system, that is assigned to this spatial structure element.The subtypes of IfcSpatialStructureElement relate to each other by using the IfcRelAggregates relationship to build the project spatial structure. Figure 1 shows the use of IfcRelAggregates to establish a spatial structure including site, building, building section and storey. More information is provided at the level of the subtypes.Figure 1 \u2014 Spatial structure element compositionHISTORY New entity in IFC2x.Informal PropositionsThe spatial project structure, established by the IfcRelAggregates, shall be acyclic.A site should not be (directly or indirectly) associated to a building, storey or space.A building should not be (directly or indirectly) associated to a storey or space.A storey should not be (directly or indirectly) associated to a space.",

The boundary is exchanged using PredefinedType BOUNDARY.A provision for voids. Such as where a particular volume of space is requested by an engineering function that might later be accepted or rejected. If accepted it is transformed into a void within a building element, like a wall opening, or a slab opening. The provision for voids is exchanged using the PredefinedType PROVISIONFORVOID. Typically this shall use a swept solid geometry, where the profile of the swept solid lies onnear the surface of the referred building element and the extrusion depths is equal to or bigger then (in case of round or otherwise irregular element shape) the thickness of the building element. The appropriate property set PsetProvisionForVoid should be attached.A clearance space. Typically a placeholder for the necessary space allocation for future designed elements, such as mechanical equipment that will be determined in a later design phase.

      "IfcProfileDef": {
        "Description": "IfcProfileDef is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry.Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters.Arbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries.Derived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available.In addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile.HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef.IFC4 CHANGE Changed from ABSTRACT to non-abstract for uses which do not require an explicitly defined geometry. Added inverse attributes HasProperties and HasExternalReference.Use in material associationBeams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition, by means of IfcRelAssociatesMaterial together with IfcMaterialProfileSet and IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. This way, building elements and element types with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and association.The profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with shape representations of the respective building elements.A higher-level description of spatial alignment of the section profile of a member (such as centered, bottom-left, in the geometric centroid, and more) can be provided within IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage by means of a cardinal point reference. This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent.Use in shape modelsProfile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or sectioned spines.The purpose of the profile definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define a uniform cross section being sweptalong a line (extrusion) using IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion or IfcExtrudedAreaSolidalong a circular arc (revolution) using IfcSurfaceOfRevolution or IfcRevolvedAreaSolidalong a directrix lying on a reference surface using IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolidThe purpose of the profile definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype IfcDerivedProfileDef is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the identity of vertices and edges.NOTE Subtypes of the IfcProfileDef contain parameterized profiles (as subtypes of IfcParameterizedProfileDef) which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given by explicit curve geometry (either open or closed profiles) and two special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a 2D Cartesian transformation.An IfcProfileDef is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to AREA. An IfcProfileDef is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this case, the inside of the profile (if the curve is closed) is not part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to CURVE.Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrates use of parameterized profiles within a swept area solid.Figure 1 \u2014 Example of standard profile definitionThe IfcProfileDef is defined within the underlying coordinate system which is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy planeof IfcSweptSurface.Position orof IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position orof each list member of IfcSectionedSpine.CrossSectionPositions.In Figure 1 to the left, the z axis of the position coordinate system points outwards of the drawing plane.NOTE The subtype IfcParameterizedProfileDef optionally provides an additional 2D position coordinate system relative to the underlying coordinate system of the IfcProfileDef.Figure 2 \u2014 Use within swept area solidsIn the later use of the IfcProfileDef within the swept surface or swept area solid, e.g. the IfcExtrudedAreaSolid (here used as an example), the profile boundaries (here based on the 2D position coordinate system of IfcParameterizedProfileDef) are placed within the xy plane of the 3D position coordinate system of the swept surface or swept area solid.The profile is inserted into the underlying coordinate system eitherdirectly in case of using IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef and IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef,through an intermediate position coordinate system in case of using IfcParameterizedProfileDef.through an 2D Cartesian transformation operator (applied directly to the curve position when using arbitrary profile definitions, or applied to the position coordinate system when using parameterized profile definitions) in case of using IfcDerivedProfileDef.when using IfcCompositeProfileDef the insertion depends on the subtype of the included sub-profiles.Profile typesResults of the different usage of the ProfileType attribute are demonstrated here. The ProfileType defines whether the inside (the bounded area) is part of the profile definition (Area) or not (Curve). Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrates the resulting area or curve depending on ProfileType.Figure 3 \u2014 AREA profile type without thicknessFigure 4 \u2014 CURVE profile type with a closed curveProfile specification by external referenceIf the profile is standardized by a norm or a catalogue, a reference to this norm or catalogue should be provided by means of HasExternalReference. This inverse relationship is used to associate an IfcExternalReference (notably IfcClassificationReference or IfcLibraryReference) with the profile.IfcClassificationReference is used to refer to a profile norm (a common standard or manufacturers standard). In this case,IfcClassificationReference.ItemReference contains the formal profile designation from the norm. (On the other hand, IfcProfileDef.ProfileName contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)IfcClassificationReference.Name carries the short name of the profile norm.Optionally, the norm can be further described by IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource.IfcLibraryReference is used to refer to a library which contains profile definitions. In this case,IfcLibraryReference.ItemReference contains the identifier of the profile within the library and is meant to be machine-readable (in contrast to IfcProfileDef.ProfileName which should be human-readable).IfcLibraryReference.Location and .Name or .ReferencedLibrary further describe the library.If an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the referenced classification or library.Direct instances of IfcProfileDefUsually, only subtypes of IfcProfileDef should be instantiated. In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes other than geometric models (e.g. for structural analysis models), it may be possible to directly instantiate IfcProfileDef and further specify the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter are tracked by the inverse attribute HasProperties.",

It is not required to be load bearing.There are two main representations for beam occurrencesIfcBeam with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might change uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. These beams are always represented geometricly by an Axis and a SweptSolid or AdvancedSweptSolid shape representation (or by a Clipping geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.IfcBeam without IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non-uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only AdvancedBrep, Brep, or SurfaceModel geometry, if a more parametric representation is not intended.For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity IfcMember should be used.REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1 structural member for carrying load(s) between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so.NOTE The entity IfcBeamStandardCase has been deleted, IfcBeam with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used instead.NOTE The representation of load-bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of IfcStructuralMember (with IfcStructuralCurveMember being mostly applicable) as part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel. The camber of a beam may be defined by assigning an IfcStructuralCurveMember with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction.HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0",

It may also represent such a member from an architectural point of view in which case it may represent a non load bearing element. Whether it is a structural load bearing element or a non-load bearing element is determined by the PsetColumnCommon.LoadBearing property.There are two main representations for column occurrencesIfcColumn with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used for all occurrences of columns, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might change uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. These columns are always represented geometricly by an Axis and a SweptSolid or AdvancedSweptSolid shape representation (or by a Clipping geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.IfcColumn is used for all other occurrences of columns, particularly for columns with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or columns defined by non-linear extrusion, or columns having only Brep, or SurfaceModel geometry, if a more parametric representation is not intended.For any longitudial structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity IfcMember exists.REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1 structural member of slender form, usually vertical, that transmits to its base the forces, primarily in compression, that are applied to it.NOTE The entity IfcColumnStandardCase has been deleted, IfcColumn with IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is used instead.NOTE The representation of a column in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralCurveMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0",

The parameters are specified on the relating IfcDoorType that references IfcDoorLiningProperties and IfcDoorPanelProperties for each panel in the doorIfcDoor entities that are not parametrically generated and have only Brep, or SurfaceModel geometry.In addition, an IfcDoor may commonly include a FootPrint representation defining the 2D shape of the door and its swing.The parameters of a door are defined by both the IfcDoor occurrence and its IfcDoorType. The IfcDoor specifiesthe door width and heightthe door opening direction (by the positive y-axis of the ObjectPlacement)The IfcDoorType specifies parameters which are common to all of its occurrences of IfcDoorthe operation type (single swing, double swing, revolving, etc.)the door hinge side (by using two different styles for right and left opening doors)the particular attributes for the lining by the IfcDoorLiningPropertiesthe particular attributes for the panels by the IfcDoorPanelPropertiesREFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1 construction for closing an opening, intended primarily for access with hinged, pivoted or sliding operation.NOTE The entity IfcDoorStandardCase has been deleted. Use an IfcDoor with a Profile representation instead. The IfcDoor should also have an IfcDoorType with ParameterTakesPrecedence set to TRUE.HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0.IFC4 CHANGE The attributes PredefinedType and OperationType are added, the applicable type object has been changed to IfcDoorType.",

However the definition of IfcPlate is material independent and specific material information shall be handled by using IfcRelAssociatesMaterial to assign a material specification to the IfcPlate.Plates are often add-on parts. This is represented by the IfcRelAggregates decomposition mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as IfcPlate, into a container element such as IfcElementAssembly or IfcCurtainWall.An instance of IfcPlate should preferably get its geometric representation and material assignment through the type definition by IfcPlateType assigned using the IfcRelDefinesByType relationship. This allows identical plates in a construction to be represented by the same instance of IfcPlateType.A plate may have openings, such as voids or recesses. They are defined by an IfcOpeningElement attached to the plate using the inverse relationship HasOpenings pointing to IfcRelVoidsElement. The position number of a plate as often used in steel construction is assigned through the attribute IfcElement.TagThere are two main representations for plate occurrencesIfcPlate with IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all occurrences of plates, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage. These plates are always represented geometrically by a SweptSolid geometry (or by a Clipping geometry based on SweptSolid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.IfcPlate without IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage is used for all other occurrences of plates, particularly for plates with changing thickness, or plates with non planar surfaces, and plates having only SurfaceModel or Brep geometry or if a more parametric representation is not intended.REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1 thin, rigid, flat, metal product, of a thickness greater than that of a sheet.NOTE The representation of a plate in a structural analysis model is provided by IfcStructuralSurfaceMember being part of an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2",

These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as followsImpart control over flow control elements (IfcFlowController) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (IfcActuator).Sensing elements (IfcSensor) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.Controllers (IfcController) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.Since IfcDistributionControlElement and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (IfcDistributionFlowElement), the objectified relationship IfcRelFlowControlElements has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.The key distinction between IfcDistributionFlowElement and IfcDistributionControlElement is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between IfcFlowMeter (subtype of IfcDistributionFlowElement measuring a flow quantity) and IfcFlowInstrument (subtype of IfcDistributionControlElement measuring a flow quality), is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures (having inletoutlet pipes for the measured substance) follows the IfcDistributionFlowElement hierarchy (and therefore IfcFlowMeter which measures the flow internally). Otherwise, if it monitorscontrols but does not connect inline within the flow system (it is external or is a component of another device), then it follows the IfcDistributionControlElement hierarchy (and therefore IfcFlowInstrument which may display various attributes through connected sensors).HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0.IFC4 CHANGE Attribute ControlElementId attribute deleted replaced by classification usage.

The IfcMechanicalFastenerType may be declared within IfcProject or IfcProjectLibrary using IfcRelDeclares and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of IfcMechanicalFastenerType are represented by instances of IfcMechanicalFastener.HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2IFC4 CHANGE Supertype changed from IfcFastenerType to IfcElementComponentType. Attributes PredefinedType, NominalDiameter, NominalLength added.Classification Use DefinitionMechanical fasteners, especially bolts, are often standardized. To refer to a formal fastener designation according to a standard (a product norm), IfcRelAssociatesClassification together with IfcClassificationReference should be used.IfcClassificationReference.Identification contains a machine-readable form of the formal fastener designation from the norm. Example M16X80-10.9-HV for a high-strength structural bolting assembly for preloading with hexagon bolt and nut. (On the other hand, IfcMechanicalFastenerType.Name contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)IfcClassificationReference.Name carries the short name of the fastener norm. Example EN 14399-4 as the respective European standard for high-strength hexagon bolts.Optionally, the norm can be further described by IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource, including information like publisher and date of issue of the norm.Furthermore, IfcRelAssociatesLibrary together with IfcLibraryReference may be used to refer to a library which contains fastener definitions."

An asset is a group that can contain one or more elements. Whilst the financial value of a component or element can be defined, financial value is also defined for accounting purposes at the level of the asset.There are a number of actors that can be associated with an asset, each actor having a role. Actors within the scope of the project are indicated using the IfcRelAssignsToActor relationship in which case roles should be defined through the IfcActorRole class otherwise principal actors are identified as attributes of the class. In the existence of both, direct attributes take precedence.There are a number of costs that can be associated with an asset, each cost having a role. These are specified through the OriginalValue, CurrentValue, TotalReplacementCost and DepreciatedValue attributes.HISTORY New entity in IFC2x.IFC4 CHANGE All attributes made optional and date values changed to use IfcDate.",

For instance, the Name attribute could be used to provide a common value that enables distinct instances to be brought together in a nesting arrangement (see below) while the Description attribute may be used to provide text used for item description in a costing schedule.An IfcCostItem can link one or many IfcCostValues representing a unit cost, total cost, or a unit cost with one or many quantities used to generate the total cost. The quantities can be given as individual quantities, or those quantities are provided as element quantities by one or many building elements. The IfcCostValue.Category attribute indicates the category of cost, which may be used to present the value in a particular column. For nested cost items (having IfcRelNests relationship), IfcCostValue.Category is significant such that IfcCostValue.AppliedValue is calculated as the sum of all nested costs having the same IfcCostValue.Category or if set to an asterisk (), then the sum of all nested costs of all cost types. An IfcCostValue may represent an original value or a value derived from formulas. For example, taxes may be calculated as a percentage of a subtotal.HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0.IFC4 CHANGE Attribute PredefinedType, CostValues, and CostQuantities added."

This coordinate system is established by SELFIfcProduct.ObjectPlacement. (This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the IfcProjects world coordinate system.)The so-called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item (connection or member). This coordinate system is established by a Representation (attribute inherited from IfcProduct) in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of IfcStructuralItem.Representation items in topology representations are always given within the ObjectPlacement, i.e. in so-called global coordinates (global with respect to the IfcStructuralAnalysisModel to which this item belongs).The usage of local coordinate systems is further defined in subtypes.Topology Use DefinitionsInstances of IfcStructuralItem shall have a topology representation. It includes a placement and a product representation. The IfcProductRepresentation shall be given by an item in a Representation of type IfcTopologyRepresentation.Local PlacementThe local placement for IfcStructuralItem is defined in its supertype IfcProduct. It is defined by the IfcLocalPlacement, which establishes a global coordinate system which shall be common to all items and activities in an IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.Topology RepresentationInstances of IfcStructuralItem shall have a topology representation given by an instance of a subtype of IfcTopologicalRepresentationItem, which should be the single item of IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items. Depending on the dimensionality of the structural item, one of the following types of topological representation items shall be usedPoint connections shall be represented by an IfcVertexPoint with an underlying IfcCartesianPoint. The Cartesian point is the reference point of the connection in the so-called global coordinate system. The following labels are used in the IfcTopologyRepresentationRepresentationIdentifier ReferenceRepresentationType VertexCurve members and curve connections shall either be represented by an IfcOrientedEdge, IfcEdgeCurve, or IfcEdge. The curve to which the IfcEdgeCurve (or an IfcOrientedEdges underlying IfcEdgeCurve) refers to is the reference curve of the structural item in the global coordinate system. Start and end vertex of the edge shall be IfcVertexPoints with underlying IfcCartesianPoints. The following labels are used in the IfcTopologyRepresentationRepresentationIdentifier ReferenceRepresentationType EdgeNOTE While an IfcEdge (or IfcOrientedEdge with underlying IfcEdge) does not provide an explicit underlying curve geometry, it may be used to imply an underlying straight line as reference curve with the origin of the curve parameter at the start vertex point.Surface members and surface connections shall be represented by an IfcFaceSurface. The underlying surface defines the reference surface of the structural surface item in the global coordinate system. All edges in the bounds of the face shall conform to the rules for edge representations of structural curve item. The following labels are used in the IfcTopologyRepresentationRepresentationIdentifier ReferenceRepresentationType FaceThe reference point, reference curve, or reference surface partially or completely defines the local coordinate system of the represented structural item according to the following rules. In all cases, The local x,y,z directions form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.Structural point itemsThe reference point in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.The axes of the local coordinate system are either parallel with and directed like the so-called global coordinate axes, or are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtype of IfcStructuralItem.Structural curve itemsThe u parameter origin of the reference curve in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.The local x axis is parallel with the tangent on the curve and directed like the u parameter direction.The local y and z axes are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtypes of IfcStructuralItem.Structural surface itemsThe u,v parameter origin of the reference surface in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.The local x and y directions follow the tangents on the surface and are in parallel with and directed like u and v respectively.The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal.Informal PropositionsThe ObjectPlacements of all structural items which are grouped into the same instance of IfcStructuralAnalysisModel shall refer to the same instance of IfcObjectPlacement.NOTE This rule is necessary to achieve consistent topology representations. The topology representations of structural items in an analysis model are meant to share vertices and edges und must therefore have the same object placement.NOTE A structural item may be grouped into more than one analysis model. In this case, all these models must use the same instance of IfcObjectPlacement."
