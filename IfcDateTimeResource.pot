msgstr "[[IfcEventTime]] captures the time related information about an event including the different types of event dates i.e. actual, scheduled, early, and late . All given values should be provided by the application, that is, the IFC schema does not deal with dependencies between process time values. At this stage there is also no consistency check through where rules that guarantee a meaningful population of date values. Thus, an application is responsible to provide reasonable values and, if an application receives event dates, has to make consistency checks by their own. [[IfcEventTime]] furthermore provides a generic mechanism to differentiate between user given time values and time values derived from user given time values and other constraints such as work calendars and assigned resources derived from the process graph .

msgid "IfcLagTime_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcLagTime]] describes the time parameters that may exist within a sequence relationship between two processes. An [[IfcLagTime]] provides information about the time lag that exists between the predecessor and successor process in a sequence. The assertion of the time lag is optional for a sequence but for work schedules that specifically deal with processes occurring at particular times, it should be asserted. A lag time has a duration type. This allows the identification of whether elapsed time or work time is being measured where work time is the estimate of the time required to complete the process and elapsed time being the amount of time actually allocated to the process The form of measurement of the duration can be captured. Allowed values for this are MEASURED, PREDICTED or SIMULATED. The selection of this value depends on the use of the schedule. A NOTDEFINED value is also allowed. The value of the time lag may be selected as being either a percentage ratio or an actual time measure. If selected as a ratio, the percentage should apply to the duration of the predecessor process relating process such that e.g. a value of 0.5 50 would indicate that the successor task should start when the predecessor task is 50 complete if a START START sequence type is used or should wait for 50 of the duration of the predecessor process to have elapsed after the finish of the predecessor process in case of a FINISH START sequence type. The time unit for the task duration may also be set and this may be set to any allowed unit of time measure. HISTORY New entity in IFC4."
