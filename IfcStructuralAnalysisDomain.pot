msgstr "The abstract entity [[IfcStructuralActivity]] combines the definition of actions such as forces, displacements, etc. and reactions support reactions, internal forces, deflections, etc. which are specified by using the basic load definitions from the IfcStructuralLoadResource . The differentiation between actions and reactions is realized by instantiating objects either from subclasses of [[IfcStructuralAction]] or [[IfcStructuralReaction]] respectively. They inherit commonly needed attributes from the abstract superclass [[IfcStructuralActivity]] , notably the relationship which connects actions or reactions with connections, analysis members, or elements subtypes of [[IfcStructuralItem]] or [[IfcElement]] . NOTE Instances of [[IfcStructuralActivity]] which are connected with an [[IfcElement]] are subject to agreements outside the scope of this specification. NOTE The semantics of [[IfcStructuralActivity]] are only fully defined if an activity instance is connected with exactly one structural item. The inverse attribute AssignedToStructuralItem can only be empty in incomplete models or in conceptual models which are not yet ready for analysis. HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Cardinality of attribute AssignedToStructuralItem relaxed from 1 to 0..1 in order to allow for schema compliant incomplete models as well as conceptual models without load item relationships. Coordinate Systems The following coordinate systems are distinguished The so called global coordinate system is the coordinate system shared by all items and activities which are grouped in a common [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] . This coordinate system is established by an ObjectPlacement . This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the [[IfcProject]] s world coordinate system. The so called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item connection or member . This coordinate system is established by a Representation in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of [[IfcStructuralItem]] . Representation items in topology representations are always given within the ObjectPlacement , i.e. in so called global coordinates global with respect to the [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] to which this activity belongs . Locations of the load objects in the AppliedLoad attribute if of type [[IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration]] are always given in local coordinates. Directions of the load objects in the AppliedLoad attribute refer to global or local coordinates according to the GlobalOrLocal attribute. The ObjectPlacement and Representation are sometimes not explicitly instantiated instead they may be implied as described below. Global and local coordinate systems are then determined in the same way as with explicit placement and representation. Topology Use Definitions Instances of [[IfcStructuralActivity]] which are connected with a structural item of same dimensionality, i.e. a point action or reaction connected with a point item [[IfcStructuralPointConnection]] , a curve action or reaction connected with a curve item [[IfcStructuralCurveConnection]] , [[IfcStructuralCurveMember]] , or a surface action or reaction connected with a surface item [[IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection]] , [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMember]] and which acts on the entire surface of the item and is not specified by isocontours shall not have an ObjectPlacement nor a Representation . It is implied that the placement and representation of the [[IfcStructuralActivity]] is the same as the ones of the [[IfcStructuralItem]] .

Instances of [[IfcStructuralActivity]] which are connected with a surface item [[IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection]] , [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMember]] and are specified by isocontours shall have a shape representation as specified below. It includes a placement and a product representation. The [[IfcProductRepresentation]] shall be given by items in a Representation of type [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] . Shape representation and topology representation may be combined. Local Placement The local placement for [[IfcStructuralActivity]] is defined in its supertype [[IfcProduct]] . It is defined by the [[IfcLocalPlacement]] , which establishes a global coordinate system which shall be common to all items and activities in an [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] . Topology Representation Instances of [[IfcStructuralActivity]] which act on parts of a surface item shall have a topology representation given by a face with underlying surface geometry, [[IfcFaceSurface]] , which should be the single item of [[IfcTopologyRepresentation]].Items . The surface establishes a local coordinate system of the activity The origin of surface parameters u,v is the origin of the local coordinate system.

In conjunction with this surface, the curve establishes a local coordinate system of the activity The origin of the curve parameter u is the origin of the local coordinate system. The local x direction follows the tangent on the curve and is directed like u. The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal of the connected surface item. The local x,y,z directions form a right handed Cartesian coordinate system. RepresentationIdentifier Reference RepresentationType Edge NOTE While an [[IfcEdge]] or [[IfcOrientedEdge]] with underlying [[IfcEdge]] does not provide an explicit underlying curve geometry, it may be used to imply an underlying straight line as reference curve with the origin of the curve parameter at the start vertex point.

msgstr "The [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] is used to assemble all information needed to represent a structural analysis model. It encompasses certain general properties such as analysis type , references to all contained structural members, structural supports or connections, as well as loads and the respective load results. Important functionalities for the description of an analysis model are derived from existing IFC entities From [[IfcSystem]] it inherits the ability to couple the built system via [[IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure]] to one or more [[IfcSpatialElement]] subtypes as necessary. From [[IfcGroup]] it inherits the inverse attribute IsGroupedBy, pointing to the relationship class [[IfcRelAssignsToGroup]] . This allows the grouping of structural members instances of [[IfcStructuralMember]] , and supports instances of [[IfcStructuralConnection]] which belong to a specific analysis model. NOTE Loads as instances of [[IfcStructuralAction]] are not included through IsGroupedBy. Loads are assigned through the LoadedBy attribute relationship, using load groups as a grouping mechanism. Only top level load groups should be referenced via LoadedBy, i.e. load combinations if any load combinations exist, or load cases if no load combinations exist in this analysis model. NOTE Results as instances of [[IfcStructuralReaction]] are not included through IsGroupedBy. Results are assigned through the HasResults attribute relationship, using result groups as a grouping mechanism. From [[IfcObjectDefinition]] it inherits the inverse attribute IsDecomposedBy pointing to the relationship class [[IfcRelAggregates]].

Coordinate Systems The following coordinate systems are distinguished The so called global coordinate system is the coordinate system shared by all items and activities which are grouped in a common [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] . This coordinate system is established by SELF [[IfcProduct]].ObjectPlacement . This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the [[IfcProject]] s world coordinate system. The so called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item connection or member . This coordinate system is established by a Representation attribute inherited from [[IfcProduct]] in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of [[IfcStructuralItem]] . Representation items in topology representations are always given within the ObjectPlacement , i.e. in so called global coordinates global with respect to the [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] to which this item belongs . The usage of local coordinate systems is further defined in subtypes. Topology Use Definitions Instances of [[IfcStructuralItem]] shall have a topology representation. It includes a placement and a product representation. The [[IfcProductRepresentation]] shall be given by an item in a Representation of type [[IfcTopologyRepresentation]] .

The following labels are used in the [[IfcTopologyRepresentation]] RepresentationIdentifier Reference RepresentationType Edge NOTE While an [[IfcEdge]] or [[IfcOrientedEdge]] with underlying [[IfcEdge]] does not provide an explicit underlying curve geometry, it may be used to imply an underlying straight line as reference curve with the origin of the curve parameter at the start vertex point.

In all cases, The local x,y,z directions form a right handed Cartesian coordinate system. Structural point items The reference point in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item. The axes of the local coordiante system are either parallel with and directed like the so called global coordinate axes, or are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtype of [[IfcStructuralItem]] . Structural curve items The u parameter origin of the reference curve in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item. The local x axis is parallel with the tangent on the curve and directed like the u parameter direction. The local y and z axes are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtypes of [[IfcStructuralItem]] . Structural surface items The u,v parameter origin of the reference surface in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.

msgid "IfcStructuralSurfaceMemberVarying_DEFINITION"
msgstr "This entity describes surface members with varying section properties. The properties are provided by means of Pset StructuralSurfaceMemberVaryingThickness via [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] , or by means of aggregation An instance of [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMemberVarying]] may be composed of two or more instances of [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMember]] with differing section properties. These subordinate members relate to the instance of [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMemberVarying]] by [[IfcRelAggregates]] . NOTE It is recommended that structural activities actions or reactions are not connected with aggregated [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMemberVarying]] but only with the [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMember]] s in the aggregation. That way, difficulties in interpretation of local coordinates are avoided. HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Use definition changed and attributes deleted. Coordinate Systems See definitions at [[IfcStructuralItem]] and [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMember]] . The local coordinates of an aggregate are generally undefined since continuity of local coordinates of the parts is not ensured. Material Use Definition In case of aggregation, only the individual parts direct instances of [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMember]] carry material and thickness information. Otherwise, definitions at [[IfcStructuralSurfaceMember]] apply. bSI Documentation"

Coordinate Systems See definitions at [[IfcStructuralActivity]] . Topology Use Definitions See definitions at [[IfcStructuralActivity]] . .spec head Informal Propositions If the surface reaction is of the predefined type CONST, SELF [[IfcStructuralActivity]].AppliedLoad must not be of type [[IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration]]. If the surface reaction is of the predefined type BILINEAR, SELF [[IfcStructuralActivity]].AppliedLoad shall be of type [[IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration]] and shall contain three items with two dimensional [[IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration]].Locations, defining the location of the result samples in local coordinates of the surface reaction. If the surface reaction is of the predefined type DISCRETE, SELF [[IfcStructuralActivity]].AppliedLoad shall be of type [[IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration]] and shall contain two or more items with two dimensional locations. If the surface reaction is of the predefined type ISOCONTOUR, SELF [[IfcStructuralActivity]].AppliedLoad shall be of type [[IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration]] and shall contain the same number of items as the set SELF.[[IfcProduct]].Representation.Representations .Items. Each item in the load configuration shall have a two dimensional location, defining the location of the result samples in local coordinates of the surface reaction. Each item in SELF [[IfcStructuralActivity]].AppliedLoad shall be located at exactly one of the isocontours. NOTE The set of representation items is unordered, hence result locations are required to correlate result values and isocontours. NOTE Isocontours are represented as IfcPCurves which are defined in terms of surface parameters u,v, while result locations are given in local surface item coordinates x,y. It is strongly recommended that the surface parameterization u,v is scaled 1 1 in order to avoid different scales of u,v versus x,y. If u,v are scaled 1 1 and the IfcPCurve s base surface is identical with the surface item s base surface, u,v and local x,y are identical. All items in SELF [[IfcStructuralActivity]].AppliedLoad [[IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration]].Values shall be of the same entity type. bSI Documentation"
